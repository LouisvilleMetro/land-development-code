> **6.1.1 Intent**
>
> The intent of this section is to manage vehicular access to land development, while preserving traffic flow in terms of safety, capacity, and speed. The site access approval procedures established herein are intended to balance the right of reasonable access to private property with the right of the citizens of Louisville and Jefferson County to safe and efficient travel. These regulations are intended to implement the Mobility Goals and Objectives of Cornerstone
>
> 2020, and Guideline 7 of the Plan Elements.
>
> **6.1.2 Approval Required**
>
> Construction of curb cuts or access to a public right-of-way serving any new development shall occur only after review of plans and receipt of the necessary permits from the Director of Works or the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. All new development shall be reviewed for compliance with the Access Management Design Manual. The Director of Works may approve deviations from the Design Manual when site conditions prevent adherence to the manual, based on a determination that the deviation is in accordance with AASHTO standards and will not create a public safety hazard. Deviations from portions
>
> of the Design Manual relating to joint access and connections between adjacent uses may be approved if the Director of Works and the Planning Director jointly determine such deviations are consistent with public safety, the form district standards and the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
>
> In addition to new development, the following changes to existing development are subject to this Part:
>
> A. existing structure is replaced by new structure or improvements; or
>
> B. existing structure or parking lot is expanded by 20% or more beyond the size existing at the effective date of this regulation (incremental changes that cumulatively increase the size by 20% fall within the regulated activities of this paragraph); or
>
> C. an existing use is changed to a use for which Chapter 9 of the Land
>
> Development Code specifies a higher parking ratio.
>
> **6.1.3 Residential Developments**
>
> When a residential subdivision is proposed that abuts an arterial or collector roadway, it shall be designed to provide lots abutting the roadway with access only from an alley, frontage road or interior local road.
>
> Direct driveway access to individual one and two family dwellings from arterial and collector roadways are prohibited unless the Planning Commission determines, in consultation with the Director of Works, that there is no acceptable access alternative.
>
> Developments with an aggregate of 200 or more dwellings (single family or multi-family) shall have at least two separate access roadways connecting directly to existing roadway(s). Developments created prior to the effective date of this paragraph and not in compliance with it may be modified, including

***NOTE:** Refer to the Access Management Design Manual(Appendix*

*6A) for specific design guidance.*

> construction of ancillary facilities and improvements to existing structures, provided that the modifications do not increase the number of dwelling units.
>
> **6.1.4 Corridor Access Management Overlay Zones**
>
> Segments of a roadway corridor may be designated as corridor access management zones for the purpose of applying special access management controls that exceed the requirements and standards in this part. The purpose of this designation is to avoid significant traffic congestion problems, reduce
>
> vehicular and pedestrian conflict areas, and to ensure appropriate development within the designated area in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
>
> The controls in such districts are not intended to be substitute for other Land Development Code provisions but can be superimposed over such provisions and should be considered additional requirements.
>
> Corridor access management zones shall be created in accordance with the public involvement and public hearing requirements applicable to the creation of any form district.
>
> **6.2.1 Applicability and General Standards**
>
> A. All new streets located in or adjoining any subdivision of land hereafter proposed shall conform to the standards of design established in this Part. In any subdivision of land hereafter proposed, the subdivider shall
>
> agree to make all dedications and complete all physical improvements as required in Table 6.2.1 before the Commission may approve the preliminary plan or minor plat. In no case shall any new lots be created or new street constructed that does not meet a pavement width of at least 18 feet, except that a five lot, five acre per lot subdivision may be accessed
>
> by a 12 foot gravel road with 3 foot earthen shoulders.
>
> B. All new development meeting one of the criteria listed in 1 through 6 below and having frontage on a public right-of-way shall dedicate land necessary to meet the minimum right -of-way width established in Table
>
> 6.2.1, unless exempted by the Planni ng Director and the Director of
>
> Works.
>
> 1. Category 3 Review (includes Major Subdivisions)
>
> 2. Rezoning/Plan Certain Development
>
> 3. Conditional Use Permit
>
> 4. Developments adjacent to legislatively adopted roadway improvement projects.
>
> 5. Developments with road impr ovements as required by Metro
>
> Public Works and/or the LDC.
>
> 6. Minor Subdivision Plats creating lots.
>
> C. Developments meeting one of the cr iteria listed above that contain land that is depicted for future roadways shown in the comprehensive plan, legislatively adopted roadway plans , or an approved road alignment study shall dedicate right-of-way as outlined within the applicable plan or study.
>
> D. All single family residential developments or detached unit condominium developments shall not create private streets unless written approval is obtained from the Directors of Works and Planning.
>
> E. All new development and subdivi sions having frontage on roadways proposed for bicycle facilities in t he Comprehensive Plan shall provide right-of-way necessary to accommodate such facilities. The applicant shall construct the bicycle facilitie s, unless the Planning Director and the Director of Works determine, based on roadway conditions or the status of adjacent segments of the bicycle facility, that construction would not be appropriate.
>
> **6.2.2 Relationship of Streets to Topography**
>
> New streets shall be so related to the topography and to existing streets as to
>
> Streets and Rights-of-Way
>
> promote the public convenience and safety and to facilitate the proper use of
>
> the land they are constructed to serve. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and storm water runoff objectives set forth in Appendix
>
> 4H (Erosion Prevention Sediment Control). Street Grades shall conform, as closely as practicable to the original topography.
>
> **6.2.3 Grade**
>
> No street grade shall be less than one per cent nor more than ten percent, unless a different grade is expressly approved by the Director of Works because of special topographical conditions.
>
> The maximum grade at any point on a street constructed without curb and gutter shall be 6 percent, unless approved by Director of Works.
>
> **6.2.4 Street Intersections**
>
> A. Number of Approaches - Intersections involving more than four basic street legs or approaches shall be prohibited. Merging lanes, deceleration lanes, '"Y" intersections and traffic circles are not included in this prohibition, but are considered as being parts of one street leg or approach.
>
> B. Angle of Intersection - For a tangent distance of at least one hundred feet measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines, all streets shall intersect at an angle of ninety degrees, where practical, but in no case shall the angle be less than seventy five degrees.
>
> C. Intersection Offset - Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out either directly opposite one another or with a minimum offset of one hundred feet between their centerlines.
>
> D. Intersection Spacing - All local and cul-de-sac streets intersecting with and entering the same side of other collector, local or cul-de-sac streets shall be located at least two hundred feet apart measured from centerline to centerline. When the intersected street is an arterial, the distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet. All other streets intersecting with and entering the same side of any other street shall be located at least five hundred feet apart, measured from centerline to centerline, unless a closer spacing is expressly approved by the Director of Works, to promote the public convenience and safety and to facilitate the proper use of the surrounding land.
>
> E. Grades at Intersections - Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection exceeds three percent, a leveling area shall be provided, having not greater than a three per cent grade for a distance of fifty feet from the intersection of the street centerline. A sag immediately adjacent to the intersecting street and a vertical curve shall be used to connect the intersection grades.
>
> **6.2.5 General Layout of Streets**
>
> A. Coordination with Surrounding Streets - A proposed street shall recognize and extend the plan and profile of off-site existing streets, and shall make possible the future extension of streets into adjacent
>
> undeveloped land. Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and convenient locations.
>
> B. Ingress and Egress - Access from new lots or a new street connecting an existing street shall not be approved unless the existing street has adequate pavement width to provide for ingress and egress to the proposed development.
>
> C. Alignment - The alignment of all streets shall be related to the centerline and shall be as follows, unless a different alignment is required by the Director of Works because of special topographical considerations or sound engineering practices:
>
> 1. Major and Minor Arterials and Collectors - the radius of all horizontal curves shall be at least 573 feet and horizontal curves shall have a desired stopping site distance of 325 feet with the minimum stopping sight distance of 275 feet. All vertical crest and sag curves shall conform to the formula L = KA. The desired K value shall be 80 with a minimum K value of 55. The design of the horizontal and vertical curves may vary based on the design speed of the roadway as determined by the Director of Works.
>
> 2. Local and Cul-de-sac Streets - All local and cul-de-sac streets shall be related to the topography of the subdivision and shall generally tend to discourage fast or through traffic.
>
> D. Corner Radii - The minimum radii at the pavement edge, or the back of the curb where required, shall be twenty-five feet for all street intersections, unless a different figure is expressly approved by the commission because of special topographical considerations or sound engineering practices. The minimum radii at the property line shall be fifteen feet for all street intersections, unless a different figure is expressly approved by the Director of Works because of special topographical considerations or sound engineering practices.
>
> E. Continuation of Existing Streets – Subdivisions shall be designed to ensure that existing public and private streets, which stub into the subject property must be extended through the subject property. For subdivisions creating any lot that abuts or has access to any proposed stub street extension, right-of-way shall be dedicated sufficient to accommodate the extension of the street, and the street shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this Land Development Code for constructing public or private roads.
>
> F. Cul-de-sac or Dead End Streets – Proposed closure of a section of cul-de- sac or dead end streets shall require installation of a turn-around or
>
> cul-de-sac unless waived by the Directors of Public Works and Planning or their designees. Signs shall be installed meeting the Manual on Uniform Transportation Control Devices (MUTCD).
>
> **6.2.6 Requirements for Specific Types of Streets and Alleys**
>
> A. Minimum Requirements - New streets shall provide right-of-way and improvements specified in Tables 6.2.1 and 6.2.2, according to the
>
> Streets and Rights-of-Way
>
> functional class of the street and the form district in which it is located, subject to the following exception:
>
> B. Development activity that meets the thresholds in the form district for Street and Roadside Design and new streets shall provide sidewalks in accordance with Tables 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 subject to the following exceptions:
>
>  Sidewalks shall not be required on lots that are five acres or
>
> greater in area and developed for single family residential uses unless they connect with existing sidewalks on both sides of the property.
>
>  Lots within approved major subdivisions in which the sidewalk(s)
>
> were waived as part of the subdivision approval for the applicable street frontage shall not be required to provide sidewalks.
>
> 1. Fee in Lieu Option - The Director of Works and the Director of Planning or designees may allow the payment in lieu of sidewalk construction upon a finding that construction of a sidewalk is not appropriate due to one of the following applicability requirements:
>
>  Sidewalks construction is impracticable due to topographical conditions or site constraints; or
>
>  A determination by the Director of Works and the Director of Planning or designees that sidewalks do not exist in the area and there is not a likelihood for sidewalks to be constructed in the future, except for areas where sidewalks are recommended within a Planning Commission or legislatively adopted plan recommending sidewalk construction.
>
> a. Amount of fee shall be set by Metro Public Works based on average sidewalk construction. The fee in lieu amount for single family residential property that is not part of a major subdivision plan shall be calculated based on the minimum lot frontage of the applicable zoning district or actual lot width, whichever is less. All fees paid shall be used for sidewalk
>
> construction within the same Metro Council District. It should be noted that payment of a fee in lieu of sidewalk construction is an option available to developers that must be approved by the Director of Works and the Director of Planning or designees. Applicants retain the right to request a sidewalk waiver (see B.2 below); in no case shall the Planning Commission or Director of Works require the payment of a fee in lieu of sidewalk construction. The fee in lieu option shall not be approved and the sidewalk shall be constructed when one of the following situations apply:
>
>  Where an existing sidewalk network can be completed or extended, except in locations where site constraints cause construction difficulties as determined by the Director of Works and the Director of Planning or designees.
>
>  The required sidewalk would provide a direct means of
>
> access to a lot that contains a pedestrian generator such as a school, church, library, community center or park.
>
> b. A new fee in lieu or sidewalk shall not be required in the future for a street frontage in which a fee in lieu has already been
>
> approved and paid.
>
> 2. Sidewalk Waiver a. Applicability:
>
> Any development site required to provide a sidewalk in accordance with applicable form district threshold tables of Chapter 5 of this
>
> code may submit an application for a sidewalk waiver in accordance with the submittal requirements of paragraph 2b below.
>
> b. Submittal Requirements:
>
> i. A plan (e.g. development plan (plan certain or category review), minor plat, preliminary subdivision plan or conditional use permit plan.)
>
> ii. A justification document, which addresses as applicable the following items:
>
> (a) How the proposed waiver conforms to the Comprehensive Plan and the intent of this Land Development Code;
>
> (b) Why compliance with the regulations is not appropriate and granting of the waiver will result in a development more in keeping with the Comprehensive Plan and the overall intent of this Land Development Code;
>
> (c) What impacts granting of the waiver may have on adjacent property owners;
>
> (d) Why strict application of the provision of the regulations would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant.
>
> c. Review Process:
>
> i. Notice shall be given in accordance with the provisions of LDC
>
> waivers as listed in Chapter 11 of this code.
>
> ii. The Planning Commission or designee or BOZA (only in conjunction with a review of a variance or conditional use permit request) shall review the waiver request in order to hear comments from concerned citizens and to review comments from Planning and Design Services staff and other agencies.
>
> iii. The Planning Commission or designee or BOZA (only in conjunction with a review of a variance or conditional use permit request) may approve waivers or modifications of standards upon a finding that:
>
> (a) The waiver will not adversely affect adjacent property owners; and
>
> (b) The waiver will not violate the Comprehensive Plan; and
>
> (c) The extent of waiver of the regulation is the minimum necessary to afford relief to the applicant.
>
> Streets and Rights-of-Way
>
> iv. The Planning Commission or designee or BOZA (only in conjunction with a review of a variance or conditional use permit request) may grant a waiver to allow a reduced sidewalk requirement where less than 50% of the street frontage is being developed. A reduction waiver shall not exempt future development on the parcel from the construction of the remainder of the sidewalk.

>
> C. Responsibility for Coordination of Street Name Assignments

DPDS will also be responsible for notification of all appropriate agencies of approved street names that have been entered into the Street Index File.
>
> D. How Street Name Assignments May be Initiated
>
> The approval process for new street names may be initiated as part of any of the following development approval procedures. Applicants for preliminary subdivision plan review are encouraged to seek street name approval as part of the preliminary plan application.
>
> 1. Preliminary Plan for Major Subdivision: Street names may be submitted for approval with a Preliminary Plan for Major Subdivision. Approval of the preliminary plan with street names may be given by the Planning Commission, the Technical Review Committee or the Planning Director. A street name review fee is not required for street name assignments that are part of an application for preliminary subdivision plan review.
>
> 2. Record Plat for Major Subdivision: Approved street names shall be shown on all major subdivision record plats. A street name
>
> review fee is not required for street name assignments that are part of an application for major subdivision record plat review.
>
> 3. Minor Subdivision: Street names must be submitted for approval with a Minor Subdivision Plat. Approval of the plat with street names may be given by the Planning Commission or the Planning Director. A street name review fee is not required for street name assignments that are part of an application for minor subdivision plat.
>
> 4. Condominium Property Regime Plan: Street names may be submitted for approval with a Condominium Property Regime Plan. Approval of the plan with street names may be given by the Planning Commission or the Planning Director. A street name review fee is required for street name assignments within condominium property regime plans.
>
> 5. Development Plan Review: Street names may be submitted for approval with a General Development or Detailed District Development Plan associated with a zoning district change. Approval of street names may be given by the Planning Commission or the Planning Director. A street name review fee is not required for street name assignments that are part of an application for general or detailed district development plan approval.
>
> 6. Street Name Change: Street name assignment requests that cannot be submitted as part of one of the development approvals listed above may utilize the street name change application process. Approval of these types of requests shall be given in accordance with Section 6.3.2 of this Land Development Code. A street name review fee is required for street name assignments.
>
> E. Time Limits for Street Name Approvals
>
> Street name approvals are limited to the effective period of the associated development approval as listed in this Code. For example, a street name approval contained with a preliminary subdivision plan approval is effective for one year. At the end of the one year period, the preliminary subdivision plan and street name approvals would expire if the applicant has not filed a record plat for the property or requested an extension of the preliminary approval as provided in this Code.
>
> F. Reservation of Street Names
>
> Property owners and registered agents may apply to the Division of Planning and Design Services for a street name reservation. Street name reservations have a maximum effective period of six months and
>
> may not be extended except through a new application process. A street name review fee is required.
>
> G. Duplication of Existing Street Names Not Permitted
>
> To eliminate potential confusion and delay of emergency response, duplication of street names shall not be permitted. Streets with the same name but different street type designations shall be considered duplicate street names (e.g., Chesterfield Drive and Chesterfield Road are duplicates). Proposed street names and name changes shall be compared with street names listed in the Street Index File (SIF) to determine if the proposal would create a duplicate name.
>
> H. Similar or Confusing Spelling of Street Names Not Permitted
>
> To eliminate confusion resulting from diction problems when individuals are reporting street names under stress, similar (text or phonetic) or confusing spelling of street names shall not be approved. The following are examples of the issues described in this section.

| Example                     | Problem                           |

> Street names of 12 or fewer characters are encouraged to maximize visibility of street signs. New street names shall not contain more than 16 characters, which does not include either the direction (north, east, etc.)
>
> or the street type (lane, drive, etc.). Names shall not contain hyphens, apostrophes, or other non-letter characters. New street names shall not contain more than two words, exclusive of direction or street type.
>
> J. Permanent Voids (Use of Same Name For Interrupted Streets)
>
> To preserve the continuity of street names, and accommodate permanent interruptions to streets including limited access freeways, streams or railroad facilities, the same street name shall not be continued on both sides of a permanent physical interruption to the road.
>
> K. Continuation of Street Names
>
> Streets continuing through an intersection shall keep the same name. For commercial, multi-family, or townhouse developments that have an entrance or access through a publicly maintained cul-de-sac, a separate street name will be required for the entrance or access road in the event that it serves or is intended to serve two or more address numbers.
>
> Street names shall not be changed due to a change in direction of the street, nor shall a new prefix be used for those streets that meet the criteria for using a directional indicator in the street name.
>
> L. Use of Directional Indicators in Street Names
>
> Directional indicators, such as north and west, shall not be included in street name proposals as a prefix or suffix to a street name. When streets cross the east/west or north/south zero baseline the appropriate
>
> directional indicator may be assigned by DPDS as part of the street name approval process.
>
> M. Street Type Designations
>
> Street type designations shall be assigned by the Planning Commission or its designee. Street names submitted for review will be evaluated for conformance with the criteria provided below. Street type designations that appear on approved subdivision, development and condominium plans shall be consistent with approved designations. Abbreviations of street type designations shall be consistent with NENA (National Emergency Number Association) standards as depicted in Appendix 6B. See table below for the categories which comprise the range of street types that may be approved.

It shall be located as close to the property line and as far from the inters ection as site conditions allow. Only one driveway will be pe rmitted and it sha ll access the roa d frontage of the stre et having th e lower f unctional classification, unless th e Director determines that this would create a safety or operational pro blem on the public street system.
>
> **1.5 Joint and Cross Access**
>
> ![](./media/image15.png)A. Properties located on arterial or collector roadways should provide a cross acces s drive and p edestrian access to a llow circulation between adjacent sites as required by the Director of Works. Such connection is generally required in th e following circumstances:

>
> **1.6 Requirements for Unified Access and Circulation**
>
> A. In the interest of promoting uni fied access and circula tion systems, integrated development sites comprised of m ore than one buildin g or m ore than one lot are not co nsidered separate properties in relation to the access managem ent standards of this code. T his will also apply to phased develo pment plans. In addition, the following standards apply:
>
> ![](./media/image23.png)1. The number of curb cuts permitted shall be the minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access to the ov erall site and not the maximum available for that frontag e. Reasona ble access shall b e determined by the Director of Works.
>
> 2. All necessary easements, agreements, and stipu lations required under Section 1.5 (C) shall be m et. Subsequent owners and lessees within the affected area are responsible for compliance with these requirements.
>
> 3. Outparcels should be accessed via the shared circulation system of the principal de velopment or retail center. Access to outparcels should be designed to avoid
>
> excessive movement across parking aisles and queuing across surrounding parking and driving aisles.
>
> B. Where abutting properties are in di fferent ownership and not part of an overall developm ent plan, cooperation between the various owners to create a unified access and circulation system is encouraged.. Abutting properties shall provide un ified access and circ ulation at the tim e that they are develop ed, or are redeveloped as provided in Section 1.8.
>
> **1.7 Driveway Location and Design**
>
> A. Sight distance at driveway approaches m ust be located and designed in conform ance with appropriate AASHTO, ITE or other applicable standards.
>
> B. The Director of Works may require deceleration or storage lanes where deemed necessary due to traffic volumes, speed lim its, or where there m ay be a safety or operational problem . The design of left- turn and right-turn deceleration/storage lanes shall conform to appropriate agency standards.
>
> C. Due to the potential for vehicular weaving conflicts and crashes, constructi on of driveways along acceleration or deceleration lan es, left turn sto rage

Avoid:

> Driveways not aligned
>
> Drivew ays along turning lanes, and close to intersections
>
> lanes and tapers is to be avoided, unless no other access to the property is available.
>
> D. Driveways across from median openings should be consolidated wherever feasible, to coordinate access at the median opening.
>
> ![](./media/image27.png)E. Driveways on undivided roadways should be aligned directly oppos ite driveways on the opposite side of the road, or offse t from each other in accordance w ith applicable County or State Highway Standards, due to the potential for conflicting left turns or jog m aneuvers and resulting safety or operational problems.
>
> F. Driveway width and return radius or flare shall be adequate to serve the volum e of traffic and provide for efficient m ovement of vehicles onto and off of t he major thoroughfare. However, the width of driveways shall not be so excessive as to
>
> pose safety hazards for pedestrians and bicycles. The Director of Works may require longer radii and/or wider throats where deemed necessary to accommodate trucks.
>
> G. Driveways with m ore than two lanes should incor porate channelization featur es. Double-yellow lines may be considered instead of medians where truck off-tracking is a problem.
>
> H. Driveways shall be designed with a dequate on-site storage for entering and exiting vehicles to reduce unsafe conflicts with through or on-s ite traffic and to avoid congestion at the entrance. These guidelines are intended for the principal access to the property and are not intended for minor driveways.

> **APPENDIX 6C**
>
> **JEFFERSON COUNTY ADDRESSING MANUAL**
>
> A. Authority of the Planning Director
>
> The Planning Director or designee shall assign addresses in accordance with the following procedures. When circumstances dictate, the Planning Director may authorize address assignments that diverge from the standards in this section.
>
> B. Address Grid System
>
> Each new subdivision parcel, each pad in a mobile home park, commercial unit, apartment, condominium, or townhouse shall be assigned an address on the street providing access to the parcel. Addresses will be assigned based on a countywide grid system.
>
> The grid system allows a series of numbers to be assigned for approximately every 500 feet. The address grid includes the NW, NE, SW, and SE quadrants of Jefferson County and uses primary routes within the County as zero baselines.
>
> C. Address Grid Baselines
>
> Jefferson County’s address numbering system shall be on a grid system that divides Jefferson County into quadrants establishing zero baselines from which numbers are assigned. The grid system, as shown on the property numbering map on file in the office of the Commission, indicates the point at which block numbers will change in increments of 100.
>
> Assigned address numbers under the grid system will ascend numerically from 100 to the north and to the south based on Main Street/Shelbyville Road as the boundary or zero baseline for streets that are aligned basically North and South. Streets that are aligned basically east and west shall be assigned address numbers ascending numerically from 100 to the east and to the west based on First Street as extended to the county boundary representing the boundary or zero baseline. The directional orientation of a number street shall be determined by the Planning Director or the Commission. Numbers on the north side of the east-west streets shall be odd and numbers on the south side of the east-west streets shall be even. Numbers on the west side of the north-south streets shall be even and numbers on the east side of the north-south
>
> streets shall be odd.
>
> D. Application of Address Grid
>
> Application of the address grid will vary, as few streets run directly north, south, east or west. Most streets run at angles to the cardinal directions and often change direction. The primary consideration for assigning addresses on streets that diverge from the cardinal directions is the even distribution of address numbers. The grid shall be used to assist in assigning numbers by orienting the grid parallel to the direction of the street. In this manner, an appropriate distance between address numbers can be maintained.
>
> E. Addressing Single Family Dwelling Lots
>
> Addresses for single family dwelling lots shall be assigned consecutively on the odd and even sides of the street.
>
> F. Addressing Mobile Home Parks
>
> Addresses for home sites in mobile home parks are assigned consecutively on the odd and even sides of the street. A separate street address number shall be assigned for each mobile home pad. No unit numbers shall be assigned to mobile home park developments.
>
> G. Addressing Townhouse Developments
>
> Addresses for townhouse units are to be assigned consecutively on the odd and even sides of the street. A separate street address number shall be assigned for each townhouse lot. No unit numbers, such as apartment numbers, shall be assigned to townhouse developments.
>
> H. Addressing Commercial, Office, and Warehouse Developments
>
> Staff shall evaluate commercial, office and warehouse developments for address assignment based on the maximum potential number of units. Large stores, offices and warehouses may be divided into smaller spaces many years after the center is constructed. Staff will take into account the potential for readdressing the potential must be taken into account to avoid potential readdressing.
>
> I. Addressing Commercial Shopping Centers
>
> Commercial shopping centers shall generally be addressed in a manner similar to townhouses. Because the frontage dimension for each store may change as the use changes, site development plans for shopping centers shall include the maximum number of potential use units within the center in order to provide the maximum number of addresses. The location of the door to an individual use unit providing primary access is the critical factor in determining which available address applies.
>
> In the event that a shopping center may allow more street addresses than are available with the segment of street, the Planning Director may assign one street address to the shopping center as a whole, and assign unit numbers for each of the potential use units within the center. Unit numbers for the stores shall run as consecutive whole numbers in the same direction as the addresses on the street. Unit numbers shall begin with 101 and progress until all use units have been addressed. No lower numbers, including 100, shall be used. The same procedure and information shall be used in assigning addresses and unit numbers for office and warehouse
>
> developments.
>
> In shopping centers with multiple stories, each story shall be assigned four digit addresses beginning with 2100 on the second story and increasing by 1000 for each additional story. For example, stores on the first floor of a shopping center may run from 100 to
>
> 122, while stores on a second level of the shopping center may run from 2100 to 2122, and stores on a third level of the shopping center may run from 3100 to 3122. In this manner, it will be easier to locate a store in an emergency by providing a logical separation between levels in the shopping center.
>
> J. Addressing Commercial Shopping Malls
>
> Malls shall be addressed with one street address number assigned to the street intersecting with the main vehicular entrance. Separate address numbers shall not be assigned to each entrance of shopping malls. The maximum number of stores is to be included on the site development plans as well as the minimum potential store frontage. Based on this information, unit numbers shall be assigned using an odd and even distribution on either side of the mall corridor(s). Unit numbers shall begin with 101 on the odd (north and east) side and
>
> 100 on the even (south and west) side.
>
> In malls with multiple corridors, each corridor shall be assigned numbers in higher hundred divisions. For example, stores in one corridor may run from 100 to 147, and stores in an adjoining corridor would run from 200 to 238. In this manner, it will be easier to locate a store in an emergency by providing a logical separation between corridors in the mall.
>
> In malls with multiple stories, each story shall be assigned four digit addresses beginning with 2100 on the second story and increasing by 1000 for each additional story. For example, stores on the first floor of a commercial shopping mall may run from 100 to 147, while stores on a second level of the shopping mall may run from 2100 to
>
> 2147, and stores on a third level of the shopping mall may run from
>
> 3100 to 3147. In this manner, it will be easier to locate a store in an emergency by providing a logical separation between levels in the mall.
>
> K. Addressing Offices and Multi-Family Dwellings
>
> These procedures include residential and office buildings of the same construction design as apartment buildings. Multi-family housing units, such as apartments and condominiums, will have a separate whole number street address assigned to each door/entrance providing access to units within an individual building(s). Street addresses shall be assigned based on the normal criteria for assignment, skipping numbers in accordance with the grid and using the appropriate odd and even numbering scheme for building entrances.
>
> Within structures having dwelling units placed one above another, a consecutive whole unit number (referred to as apartment, suite, or unit number) shall be assigned for each separate dwelling unit. The numbers shall be assigned in the same direction as the street numbers. The lowest floor shall begin with 101, progressing with
>
> 102, 103, etc., until all units have been assigned unit numbers. Successively higher floors shall begin with successively higher increments of hundreds. The complete official street address for each unit will consist of the street address, street name, and unit number.
>
> When a single story multi-family structure has frontage along two streets, and has doors/entrances to individual dwelling units from each street, a separate street address will be assigned to each dwelling unit.
>
> L. Addressing Marinas
>
> This procedure includes all water-based facilities for the long term (more than six months) docking and storage of boats that may be used as dwelling units. Marinas shall be addressed in the following manner. The marina will be assigned a street address, and each dock providing access to individual boat slips shall be designated by a letter of the alphabet, beginning with “A” for the dock closest to the street entrance to the marina.
>
> A whole unit number (1,2, etc.) shall be assigned for each separate boat storage slip beginning on the right side of the dock and continuing around the dock to the slip closest to the beginning of the dock on the left side. The complete official street address for each unit will consist of the street address, street name, dock indicator (alpha) and slip indicator (numeric).
>
> M. Assignment of Addresses to Corner Lots
>
> Residential and commercial lots which have frontage on two streets that are required to be named (See 06-03-05A), regardless of whether the streets are private or public, shall be assigned an address for each frontage street which the lot abuts. After the building is established, the Fire Protection District with jurisdiction shall determine which address will be used for the lot and report their decision to the Planning Commission.

> I. INTRODUCTION
>
> The Louisville and Jefferson County Planning Commission requires that a ll traffic data and/or a nalysis either by a project proponent or opponent m ust be first reviewed by the Jefferson County Public Works and Transportation Division. This is to insure compliance with these guidelines and the comprehensive plan.
>
> The purpose of this docum ent is to pr ovide guidance to devel opers and consultants re garding traffic i mpact studies and air quality analysis su bmitted as attachments to proposed development plans in J efferson County, Kentucky. These studies can be usef ul decision m aking tools and. whe n warranted, are an important component of a development petition. These guidelines are intended to provide consistency in the preparation of im pact studies. The y are provided as a reference only. The analysis required for a traffic impact study shoul d be conducted onl y under the supervision of a transportation engineer with specific training in traffic engineering. The air quality analysis should be conducted only by a professional certified by the Air Pollution Control District.
>
> Notes which provide definitions for the technical terms discussed herein and those that should be addressed in an impact study are included in Appendix A. Elements of a recommended impact study are presented in Appendix B and sample traffic analysis forms are shown in Appendix D. The e mission data required for air quality analysis generated by the Ai r Pollution Control District is presented in Appendix E. The major acceptable sources of information and reference are presented in Appendix F.
>
> II. WARRANTS FOR REQUIRING AN IMPACT STUDY
>
> The Jefferson County Public Works and Transportation Division (PW&T), as the in itial step in the r eview process of a proposed develo pment plan, will evaluate th e need for a traffic im pact study. The need for a traffic impact study will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The criteria described below will be used by the PW&T staff in its recommendations of need for a traffic impact study. The final decision to require a traffic impact study will be determined by th e Director of Public Works, based on staff recommendations. If a traffic im pact study is determ ined to be n ecessary, a report of the study's findings must be transmitted to and reviewed by PW&T staff before a recommendation on the proposed development plan will be made to the Planning Commission. For air quality concerns the APCD shall determine when an analysis perform ed by or f or the developer is required. In m ost instances a traffic and air quality impact study would be jointly performed, however, either or both may be waived when conditions warrant.
>
> The normal maximum time required for review and comment is two weeks. Should action be r equired of the APCD's Board this time would be extended to be compatible with the Boards regular mont hly meeting every third Wednesday. An impact study may be requested if any of the following conditions are present:
>
> A. *Significantly Sized Project:* The proposed developm ent is of sufficient size to have a substantial impact on a particular local area. The proposed developm ent is considered to meet this criteria if it generates two hundr ed (200) or more peak hour trips according t o the current editions of Trip Generation, published by the In stitute of Transportati on Engineers, locally generat ed data or other acceptable source.
>
> B. *Nearby Congestion:* The proposed development, of any size, is l ocated near roadways, intersections or set of intersections w hich have been identified by the Di rector of Public W orks as being already heavily congested.
>
> C. *Modification* to *Roadway:* When the proposed developm ent is located near a roadway s egment identified by the Di rector of Public Works as within a problem area, needing to be w idened or improved. This crit eria will also be satisfied if the proposed development plan inc ludes modifications to the State or County roadway system.
>
> D. *Traffic Control Signal:* This warrant will be satisfied if the proposed development plan includes the installation of a new or the modification of an existing traffic control signal.
>
> E. *Air Quality:* The proposed development is located in or will affect potential "Hot Spot" a rea, as identified in the Core Graphics of the Comprehensive Plan or an area of special air quality concern.
>
> III. RECOMMENDED CONTENTS OF AN IMPACT STUDY
>
> The developer shall be responsible for all data collection, an alysis, and reporting ass ociated with the tr affic and air quality studies. The results of the developer's effo rts will be reviewed by P W&T and AP CD for content, results and acceptability. A single report documenting the traffi c and air quality studies should b e prepared. Traffic should be presented first since air quality analysis is dependent on traffic data.
>
> A. *Traffic Impact*
>
> Generally a traffic impact study w ill provide operating capacity and level of service analysis for critical roadway segments and/or intersections within a prede termined impact area. Upon determination that a traffic impact study is required, the PW&T staff, with the petitioner, will identify the area of impact, the critical intersections to be analyzed and the scope of the study. Capacity and level of service analysis will be conducted for the following conditions:
>
> 1. Existing traffic, to establish the current conditions as a point of reference;
>
> 2. Existing plus expected natural traffic growth, and approved development projects not yet completed, if any, to establish the short term future traffic conditions without the proposed development;
>
> 3. Full development traffic condition (including existing traffic, expected natural growth, approved development projects, and expected site generated traffic), to estimate future traffic conditions once the project is completed.
>
> \[NOTE: If t he proposed development is expect ed to be construc ted in phases, over a period of years, analysis for each phase of development m ust be provided for each of the above c onditions and shoul d include a predetermined rate for natural growth of through traffic.\]
>
> If the proposed development includes a request for rezoning, t he study should also include an a nalysis comparing the traffic generated by t he proposed developme nt with the traffic generated by the existing zoning or land use/zoning recommendations in Corridor Plans or Neighborhood Plans. This analysis should be very brief, possibly consisting only of a table compar ing the expected number of new trips generated by the recommended zoning and the propos ed development plan. In addition, a short narrative should be present comparing the percentage or basic differences between the two scenarios.
>
> The individual parameters of the traffic impact stu dy will be agreed upon during an initial review m eeting between the petitioner and PW&T staff. These parameters may include, but not be limited to, the following:
>
> 1. Boundary of the traffic impact area;
>
> 2 Roadway segments and critical intersections to be included in the traffic impact study;
>
> 3. Adequacy of available turning movement counts and need for additional data;
>
> 4. Period of analysis (A.M. and/or P.M. pea k hour weekday and/or weekend, depending on the development);
>
> 5. Trip generation rates or acceptable sources to be used;
>
> 6. Reductions to driveway trips due to internal circulation (if applicable);
>
> 7. Percentage of trip reassignment to account for pass-by and diverted traffic.
>
> 8. Directional distribution of site-generated traffic;
>
> 9. Mode split assumptions (if applicable);
>
> 10. Programmed projects in KIPDA's Transportation Improvemen t Program, the Comprehensive Plan's Core Graphics, along with travel demand estimating procedures for any assumptions relating to traffic diversion to new programmed facilities;
>
> 11. Roadway capacity and trends in traffic growth;
>
> 12. Acceptable methodologies to be used;
>
> 13. The range of feasible traffic engineering and operational improvements associated with the development;
>
> 14. Feasibility of including measures in the development proposal to promote transit ridership. This would require coordination with TARC *and* may include such provisions as transit stops a nd shelters with adequate pedestrian access, park-n-ride lots.
>
> 15. Possibility of implementing other transportation system management strategies such as flex-time and variable work hour programs to redistribute peak hour traffic, employer ridesharing programs, preferential parking for ridesharers, etc.;
>
> 16. Possibility of implementing provisions for alternative modes of transportation, such as bikeways, pedestrian walkways, including the provision of sidewalks along State Highways and along the County through roads system.
>
> 17. The identification of high accident locations; and
>
> 18. A formal cost esti mate of mitigation measures, (including construction, design, right-of-way and utility relocation cost). Approval of the above parameters must be given by the PW&T at this initial meeting. It is recommended that the developer, or his representative, document the discussions at this meeting and submit a lett er of conformati on to PW &T for approval. This confirmation should be obtained prior to the begi nning of analysis. F ailure to obt ain approval for the methodologies, parameters or assumptions used, in the traffic impact study, may result in rejection of the entire study by PW&T.
>
> Proposed site plans shou ld be submitted to AP CD and P W&T as soon as possible. The Public Works and Transportation Division w ill then coordinate, for APCD , the collection and analysis of a ll traffic data, by the developer. A representative f rom APCD will be as ked to attend the initial m eeting discussed above and will be informed of all mee tings, which may affect air quality, t hroughout the review Process.
>
> No traffic data, however, will be submitted to APCD by the developer. All existing and expected t raffic data will be submitted to and review by P W&T. The Pu blic Works and Transp ortation Division will forward, to APCD, only traffic data required for air quality analysis. Any discussions b etween the Developer and APCD, concerning site or gen eral traffic related issues, must be coordinated through the Public Works and Transportation Division.
>
> Should any of the proposed development's ingress/egress points be located on a ro adway controlled by the Commonwealth of Kent ucky, the petitioner is reco mmended to cont act the Kent ucky Department of Highway's district office, (District 5). A copy of the proposed development site plan should be sub mitted to the District Permit Engineer. *The* District Permit Engineer will be informed o f all meetings concerning traffic issues and asked to attend. A copy of the traffic impact study, (both draft and final), report should be submitted to the District Permit Engineer for their review and comment. Proposed mitigation measures, if any, on roadways cont rolled by the State must be approved by the Di strict Permit Engineer before approval by PW&T will be granted and recommendations to the Planning Commission will be made.
>
> B. Air Quality Analysis
>
> The traffic impact study will generate a substantial amount of data required for the air quality analysis. The traffic data used for the air quality analysis m ust be identic al to that used for traffic a nalysis. Coordination of all traffic studies shall be the responsibility of PW&T, even in those cases when only an air quality analysis is performed. Upon determination an air quality analysis is required the APCD staff will identify the intersections to be analyzed. These may or may not be the same intersections identified by PW&T for traffic analysis.
>
> Prior to beginning any air quality analysis the petitioner will atte nd the initial review meeting where APCD staff will be available to discuss th e petitioner's a ir quality analysis plan. At that m eeting data col lection, analysis techniques, assumptions, and products s hall be discussed. The following study elements relative to air quality will be covered:
>
> 1) APCD's certification process for air quality analyst;
>
> 2) Relationship between traffic studies and air quality studies;
>
> 3) Critical intersections included for air quality analysis;
>
> 4) Criteria for locating receptors;
>
> 5) Acceptable air quality model;
>
> 6) Intersection drawing requirements;
>
> 7) Emission rates from MOBILE *5* a;
>
> 8) Traffic counts needed for persistence factor;
>
> 9) Assumptions for meteorological condition;
>
> 10) Background emission levels;
>
> 11) Mitigation of air quality impacts; and
>
> 12) National Ambient Air Quality Standards;
>
> The guidelines set forth in this document and those discussed at the initial review meeting shall be followed. Any proposed deviation from the guidelines shal l be well documented and thoroughly justified in writing prior to their use. Mitigation measures should be developed with co nsideration given to their e ffects on traffic and air quality. Although most m itigation measures t hat improves traffic flow also improves air quality, this is not true for all mitigation measures.
>
> Mitigation measures should be c learly identified and should be im plementable. Before a mitigation measure can be accepted there m ust be a formal enforceable agreem ent with the party responsible fo r implementation.
>
> IV. HOW THE IMPACT STUDY WILL BE USED
>
> The Jefferson County Public Works and Transportation Division staff will relate the findings from the traffic impact study to the following:
>
> A. Changes in operating delays, levels of service and volume-to-capacity ratios; B. Cost of making any necessary improvements to the transportation system;
>
> C. Comparing the impacts of a proposed rezoning with those which would occur by adherence to the
>
> Comprehensive Plan;
>
> D. Assessing the necessary capacity of the transportation system in the context of a fully developed impact area; and
>
> E. Improvements proposed by the petitioner to mitigate traffic impacts.
>
> The Air Pollution Control District staff has one major concern: Whether the air quality model predicts an exceedence of the National Ambien t Air Quality Standards. Also of concern is the i mpact on the identified potential "Hot Spots".
>
> Major conclusions reached by the PW&T and APCD will be discussed with the petitioner and incorporated into the st affs' comments and reported to the Lo uisville and Jeffers on County Planning Commission. Three (3) copies of the fi nal study report shall be submitted, by the petitioner, to the Jefferson County Public Works and Tran sportation Division, two (2 ) copies to the Air Pollu tion Control District of Jefferson County, and one (1) copy to the Planning Commission at a mini mum of two (2) weeks prior to its Land Development and Transportation (LD&T) Committee, which is held on alternating Thursdays. Where applicable one (1) copy shou ld be submitted to the District permit Engineer at the Kentucky Department of Highways' District 5 Office. Informa tion presented within the final repor t, backup supporting data and staff comments from PW&T and APCD, will be made available to concerned citizens of Jefferson County requesting this information. A detailed descri ption of the information to be included and a typical outline for the final report is presented in Appendix C. In addition, the study may be used by the PW&T staff to identify needed transportation improvements, right-of-way re quirements and the potential for developer contributions to need ed improvements. Written commitmen ts regarding these issues may be incorporated, for plan approval, in the form of binding elements by the developer.
>
> Based on this analysis the APCD will make recommendations to the Planning Commission, in regards to the proposed development's impact on air quality. Any ne gative recommendation must h ave official approval of the APCD Board. Tr affic improvements required to reduce the developments impact on air quality may be identified, with the assistance of PW&T. If these mitigation measure represent sound traffic engineering practices, they may be incorporated in to proposed binding elements for the approved plans.
>
> APPENDIX A TECHNICAL NOTES
>
> **A. Trip Generation**: Average trip generation rates or regression equations for the peak hour of the adjacent street will be obtained from the current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineer's *Trip Generation* Manual or Local Trip Generation Study published i n October 1993. Other local data may be acceptable provi ded it was collected using r ecommended methodology and can be properly documented.
>
> **B. Peak Hour Percent**: A peak hour percentage of 10 pe rcent of the daily trips will be assumed for existing traffic unless hourly counts are available.
>
> **C. Peak Hour**: The petitioner shall use the peak one hour period which occurs during either 7-9
>
> A.M. or 4-6 P.M. periods or both, as agreed to by the staff and petitioner. In some cases, however, the PW&T staff may require additional hour s, for example, Friday nights or S aturday afternoon, to also be analyzed.
>
> **D. Directional Split**: The directional split of the entering an d exiting traffic associated with t he development will be derived from the ITE Trip Generation manual unless other acceptable locally generated data is available.
>
> **E. Pass-by Trips**: The percent of pass-by-tr ips shall be app lied to the trips generated by the proposed development and a ssigned to the adjacent street networ k. This rate does not affect t he proposed project's driveway volumes but rather reassi gns existing trips to movements entering and existing the proposed developm ent. The pass-by trip rates w ill be agreed upon during the preliminary meeting. The following pass-by trip rates have been determined for some land uses in Jefferson County:
>
> Retail 30-35% Quality and Sit Down Restaurants 25% Fast-Food Restaurants 30-50% Banks 55% Convenience/Gas Stations 55-60%
>
> These rates were determined as part of a Local Tr ip Generation Study. The use of these rates ar e recommended, however, the develo per may su pply additional information for rev iew and consideration.
>
> **F. Diverted Linked Trips**: A reassignment for diverted trip s will generally occur outside the impacted study area; therefore, for the purpose of these traffic impact studies, diverted trips would be considered "new trips" within the st udy area and can be ignored in most cases. This factor, if applicable, will be decided during the preliminary meeting.
>
> **G. Internal Circulation Trips:** Reductions for internal circula tion trips are applicable for projects such as shopping centers with out-lots and represents a reduction in projected driveway trips. The internal circulation trip rate will be agreed upon during the preliminary meeting and shall not exceed
>
> 10 percent.
>
> **H. Trip Distribution**: The directional distri bution of the generated trips entering and exiting th e proposed development via all access points must be justi fied by the re lative locations of other traffic generators (e.g., employment centers, transportation terminals, etc.) and/or trip table information. These factors, or other factors agre ed upon by the st aff, shall be applied to the traffic generated by the proposed development as well as the traffic generated by nearby approved projects.
>
> **I. Trip Assignment**: The distribution factors shall be applie d to the trips genera ted by the proposed development and nearby approved projects and assigned to the existing traffic on the road network providing access to the proposed development.
>
> **J. Capacity Analysis**: At the identified critical inter section(s), the existing and generated traffic is to be related to the adequacy of the intersection by using the techniques described in Chapters 9 and 10 of the *1985 Highway Capacity Manual.* Special Report 209. The PW&T staff has the necessary computer program to review and veri fy this analysis. Link volume analysis shall also be related to the *Highway Capacity Manual* standards. The a nalysis should be carried out for the A.M. and/or P.M. peaks, as agreed to by the staff and petitioner. This analysis should use traffic data for non- holiday weekdays, unless specifically requested by PW&T staff to analyses other periods. It is also recommended that the operational methodology be used in the analysis of signalized intersections. If so desired, alternative capacity and level of s ervice analysis techniques may be used, provided data is presented in such a form that the results may be duplicated using the latest version of the Highway Capacity Software and Signal Software sponsored by FHWA and McTrans, respectively.
>
> **K. Traffic Data:**
>
> 1 Traffic volume data IS *NOT* available from PW&T at this time. Average Daily Traffic volumes, turning movement counts and traffic control signals data on roadways m aintained by the Commonwealth of Kentucky *MAY B E* available from the Department of Highways or KIPDA. The above sources s hould be contacted concerning the a vailability of traffic data. If, however, acceptable data is not available, the petitioner is responsible for obtaining such data.
>
> 2. Traffi c count data should be adjusted to the current year, or new counts should be made by t he applicant if, in the opinion of the PW&T staff, traffic volumes have significantly increased due to some change(s) in t he traffic pattern, such as the completion of a d evelopment project after the count was made.
>
> 3. If turning movement data is outdated or if there are locations fo r which dat a is n on- existent, data must be acquired at the applicant's expense.
>
> 4. Intersection traffic counts conducted by the pe titioner should be com prised of manual t urning movement counts covering the period of 7-9 A.M. a nd 4-6 P.M. in order to allow f or the selection of the peak hour wi thin the nearest fifteen minutes (e.g., 4: 00-5:00, 4:15-5:15, etc). The inclusion of all 7-9 A.M. and 4-6 P.M. turning movement data is requested as part of the petitioner traffic i mpact analysis., Su mmaries of each fifteen m inute period should be submitted, under separate cover, to PW&T. (A typical turning movement count summary form is present in Appendix D.)
>
> 5. Ideally the traffic analysis should be performed for the design hour which represents the 30t h highest hourly traffic volume on an annual ba sis. However most peak hour traffic volumes counts in urban areas closely approximately the 30th highest hour. Excepti on to this generalization are when special events occur, holidays (and holiday per iods), and the month of December. Although these periods should be avoided for traffic counting, on occasions because of scheduling considerations counts are made. Such counts should be adjusted to approximate the
>
> 30th highest hourly traffic volumes. Historical counts a nd staff knowledge of the area will be used to judge the adequacy of counts used by the applicant.
>
> 6. If the proposed development includes plans for the installation of a new traffic control signal, the petitioner must conduct a Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis. This analysis would produce documentation that indicates the conditions at th e proposed location w arrant a traffic signal by meeting the recommended m inimum warrants presented in the M *anual for Uniform Traffic* *Control Devices.* (MUTCD). Documentation of this analysis should be included in the appendix of the final report and should include, but n ot be limited to, the methodology used, daily traffic count data used in the analysis, and the resulting capacity analysis results at this location. A simple analysis form is presented in Appendix D.
>
> **L. Adequate Accommodation of Traffic**: The ability of a high way system to carry traffic is expressed in terms of volum e-to- capacity (V/C) ratios an d level of s ervice at the critical l ocations, usually intersections. The V/C ratios clearly define the degree of saturation at an intersection. A V/C ratio of
>
> 1.0 indicates that the intersection is operating at its theoretical capacity, that is, the traffic volume demand equals the estimated number of vehicle that may pass through the intersection in a given period of t ime. A val ue of over 1.0 depi cts a s ituation where the demand exceeds the intersection's capacity and operational problems exist, either in geometries or signalization. As the V/C ratio approaches 0.9, breakdowns in the operational efficiency of the intersection tend to develop. When the V/C increases above 0.9, operational breakdowns also increase in freque ncy and m ay result in a high level of delay to motorists.
>
> In considering mitigation measures, the change in V/C ratio and level of service must be taken into account as well as the actual V/C values for individual approaches a nd the overall i ntersection. If no mitigation exists or if the impr ovements required are beyond what could r easonably be expected from the petitioner, then negotiations between the petitioner and PW&T staff members will be conducted to determine the level of petitioner responsibility for improvements at the intersection.
>
> Level of service for sig nalized intersections is defined by the Transportation Research B oard's Special Report 209, **1985 Highway Capacity Manual**, in terms of delay. Generally, d elay is considered a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, lost time and fuel consumption. Delay at signalized intersections is a result of a number of factors, including the signal's cycle length, phasing, progression in relation to other signals, traffic volumes and the intersection's lane configuration and geometries. Although they are an important c onsideration in intersection analysis, delay and level of service results should not be used in determ ining mitigation measures. The PW&T staff will rely primarily on the V/C ratio in determining the effectiveness of proposed mitigation measures.
>
> "Levels of service" as d efined by the **1985 Highway Capacity Manual** are presented in T able
>
> A-1.
>
> **M. Air Quality Analysis Model:** The recommended model for roadway and signalized intersections is CAL3QHC. A copy of the com puter program and user's guide prepared by t he U.S. Environmental Protection A gency may be purchased from Pollution C ontrol District. CAL3QHC is a microcomputer-based modeling methodology developed to predict the level of carbon monoxide (CO) emitted from motor vehicles traveling near roadway intersections.
>
> **N. Mapping**: The application of the CAL3QH C model requires a s cale drawing of each critical intersection. It is recommended that the scale be 1" = 50'. Alternative scales may be c onsidered at the initial review meeting. When a grid system is placed on the sc ale drawing the spatial relationship between the driving lanes and receptors may be rep licated within the computer model. A transparent grid has been successfully used on recent projects. The d rawings should provide existing lane configuration, lane wi dths, and location of all-rights-of-way. Contour lines and spot elevations also must be presented on each drawing. Separate drawings showing existing and proposed conditions should be provided. Copies of these drawing shoul d be submitted along with the impact analysis report.
>
> **O. Receptor Location**: The receptors should be located where the maximum total projected concentration is likely to occur (not on the roadway itself). As a rule a receptor should be l ocated outside the "mixing zone" of the travel lanes. The distance from the travel lanes should be 10 feet (3 meters) or at the right-of-way line (if no peopl e generating activity o ccurs within the right-of- way), whichever is the greatest distance.
>
> All space outside the right-of-way is considered to be available to the general public whether or not it is presently used. A dedicated buf fer zone boundary legally iden tified for landscaping purposes on which routine public access is not intended may be used to locate receptor locations rather than the right-of-way line.
>
> **P. Free Flow Speeds:** At an intersection, vehicles are consider ed to be idling when the traffic signal is red, all other times the vehicles are considered to be in a free flow mode. The speed for a free flow link represents the speed experienced by drivers tr aveling along the link d uring the time the traffic signal is not red. A free flow speed must be assigned to each link.
>
> Based on the posted speed limit the following speeds should be used as default values: *Posted Speed (mph)* *Free Flow Speed *(mph)**

| 55   | 40  |
|------|-----|
| 45   | 35  |
| 40   | 30  |
| 35   | 25  |
| 25   | 20  |

> Actual free flow speeds may be substituted for the above default values based on an acceptable documented study. The techniques in Chapter 9 of the Highway Capacity Manual ( TRB 1985) to estimate adjusted vehicle speed may be used.
>
> **Q. Emissions - MOBILE 5 a:** Separate emission rates are used as input data to CA L3QHC for each free flow and queue link. The U.S. EPA m obile source emission factor model (MOBILE 5 a) has been applied by APCD to generate both free flow and idling emission rates. Appendix E contains approved emission rates for the years 1991 through 2000. No ot her emission rates may be used without prior approval, in writing, of APCD.
>
> **R. National Ambient Air Quality Standards:** The ambient air quality st andards for carbon monoxide applicable in Jefferson County are the following Federal Standards.
>
> One Hour - 35 ppm or 40 mg/m3
>
> Eight Hour - 9 ppm or 10 mg/m3
>
> These values may not be exceeded more than once per year. Any m odeled concentrations above 35 ppm or 9 ppm is considered a violation.
>
> **S. Persistence Factor:** The CAL3QH C model is to be used to predict the one-hour worst-case concentrations. A persistence factor is used to convert the one-hour worst-case modeling results to a
>
> predicted 8-hour average concentration. The persistence factor **primarily** accounts for the variation in traffic over the eight hour peri od and can be estimated by using tr affic counts made over the eight hour period on each leg of the intersection. The se counts may be made with an automatic traffic counting machine, manual counts are not necessary. T he persistence factor is determined by dividing the average of the ei ght highest hours by the peak hour. The calculated factor shall be used if it is greater then 0.60 or less then 0. 80. if lower then 0.60 use 0.60 and if greater than 0.80 use 0.80. The eight highest hours must be continuous and must contain the peak hour.
>
> The counts on the legs of the inte rsection should be sum med for this calculation to determ ine one overall persistence factor for each intersection. Th e calculations used to de termine the pers istence factor shall be documented in the impact study report.
>
> **T. Background Concentrations:** All concentrations of carbon mo noxide that are not emitted b y the sources being m odeled are backgr ound concentrations. They can be wind blown from far away or from nearby sources such as pa rking lots and adjacent inters ections. The following background concentrations (one hour) should be used for the conditions described:

*Background*

Condition Concentration (ppm)

> 1) CBD or intersection with congested adjacent 3.0 intersection(s) and nearby parking facilities.
>
> 2) Intersection with nearby parking facilities 2.0
>
> 3) Isolated intersection (no nearby congested 1.5 intersection or nearby parking facilities).
>
> The use of background concentrations other than the above must receive prior approval, in writing, of the APCD.
>
> **U. Meteorological Conditions:** The CAL3QHC User' s Guide di scusses various meteorological parameters that are input to the model. The following values or responses shall be used for air quality analysis in Jefferson County.

> **C** Describes operations with delay in the range of 15.1 to 25.0 seconds per vehicle. These higher delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear in this le vel. The num ber of vehicles st opping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
>
> **D** Describes operations with delay in the range of 25 .1 to 40.0 seconds per vehicle. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progressi on, long cycle lengths, o r high V/C ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehi cles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
>
> **E** Describes operations with delay in the ra nge of 40.1 to 60.0 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally indicate p oor progression, long cy cle lengths, and high V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures are f requent occurrences.
>
> **F** Describes operations with delay in excess of 60.0 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most driver s. This condition often occurs with over-saturation, i.e., when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. It may also occur at high V/C ratios below 1.00 with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also be major contributing causes to such delay levels.

> **APPENDIX B STUDY ELEMENTS**
>
> The following items should be included in the impact studies submitted to the Jefferson County Public
>
> Works and Transportation Division and the Air Pollution Control District of Jefferson County.
>
> **A. Text**
>
> The text should be brief and to the p oint. It should be presented in num bered sections which contain the information as outlined below:
>
> **Part One: Traffic Impact Studies**
>
> **Section 1:** Introduction — this sec tion should ide ntify clearly the developer of the proposed development and the consultant perform ing the analysis. It should also prov ide a d escription of the site's location, using a location map to depict its location in Jefferson County. In addition, this section should detail the site's current zoning, any proposed zoning changes, zoning of the surrounding area and the total acreage to be de veloped. The Comprehensive Plan recommendations for the proposed site should also be described in this section. In addition, th is section should briefly describe the proposed project in terms of total square footage, by land use, or the number of dwelling units to be constructed. This descr iption also should inc lude the pr oposed construction schedule and the number of units, by land uses, to be constructed in each development phase.
>
> **Section 2**: Section two of the report shoul d describe the dat a collection process, t hat is, the type of data collected and when, if necessary, traffic counts were taken. This section should also include a description of the relationship between the site and the existing transportation system. This should include driveway locations, existing geo metry, average daily traffic, l ane configurations, traffic control devices at critical intersec tions, and existing and expected future functional classifications, as presented in the Comprehensive Plan Core Graphics. If applicable, the availability of public transit to the site should also be discussed.
>
> **Section 3**: This sect ion should indicate t he procedures used in the anal ysis, street segment(s)/intersection(s) to be analyzed, t rip generation rates used and their source, ti me period(s) to be analyzed, and the range of trip reassignmen ts for pass-by, divert ed, and trip r eductions for internal circulation, identifying the source of the ra tes used, expected traffic entering and exiting the site, and the assignment of those trips to the street system, expressed as a percentage of total new trips generated.
>
> **Section 4:** Discussion of the results for each condition analyzed should be submitted in section 4. A subsection should address committed roadway and intersection improvements in the area and their effect on the proposed developm ent. If the street segment(s)/intersection(s) are scheduled for improvement, a description of these improvements and the expected completion date should be included. Planned roadway or intersection improvements may also be identif ied in this section. However, planned improvements may not be co nsidered in th e analysis of the proposed development. Only projects committed to by th e state, county or loca l jurisdiction should be considered. In addition to committed improvemen ts additional mitigatio n measures should b e identified, if necessary. Analysis should be conducted and compared with results without t hese measures. Tables comparing the analysis results; should be presented within this section, and d etailed result should be presented in the appendices of the report.
>
> It should be the goal of any proposed mitigation meas ure to maintain an a cceptable V/C ratio and level of service at all critical intersections. Wh enever feasible, mitigati on measures should be developed to ensure that resulting conditions at the critic al intersections are no w orse than currently exist or are expected to exist wi th committed improvements without the proposed development. .It is realized that this is not always possible or desirable; therefore, t he main objective is to maintain an acceptable V/C ratio fo r the intersection. Detailed supporting data and analysis results used in the determination of mitigation measures should be submitted to PW&T under separate cover.
>
> **Section 5:** The final section should briefl y describe the roadway system' s ability to handle the traffic generated for each condi tion analyzed. Identify needed street improvements over a nd above those currently programmed and a reasona ble cost estimate for making the improvements. This section should also be used to document reasons for those street improvements above those currently programmed.
>
> **Part Two: Air Quality Analysis**
>
> The air qua lity analysis shoul d be well documented, however, the text should be brief. The CAL3QHC modeling printouts provide most of the details needed fo r review and verification b y the APCD. A diskette containing the data used for the CAL3QHC model runs should be p rovided. The text of the impact report should summarize the analysis. The certified air quality analyst should be identified in the report.
>
> **Section 1:** Briefly described the process and in making the air quality analysis. If the procedure in the guideline were followed, a statement to that effect is all that is needed for this Section. Tables or maps describing the input or out put of the model should be r eferenced. Should a value not recommended in the guide lines be used, the full d ocumentation justifying the deviation shoul d be presented here. (Caution: Although the documentation is presented in this report the appr oval to deviate from the guidelines must be obtained prior to the analysis.)
>
> **Section 2:** The conclusions and findings re lative to air qualit y are presented here. Mitigation measures proposed by the developer to reduce air quality impacts should be described. If the mitigation measure is to be implemented by som eone or agency other tha n the developer an offi cial statement must be included (letter of commitment) from the other party.
>

>
> The appendix should include the output summary from the Highway Capacity software, or, if other procedures are used, equivalent docu mentation which would permit PW&T staff to easily replicate the procedures. Documentation should be provided for each conditi on analyzed. (Detailed results from the Highway Capacity Software should be provided under separate cover to PW&T).
>
> All relevant data neces sary to con duct an analys is using the Highway Capacity software s hould be provided within the appendix. This da ta includes assumptions or actual counts of truck and transit traffic, right turns on red, pedestrian traffic and parking m aneuvers. This data should also include a di agram showing the iissumed phasing and ti ming for each signalized intersection analyzed. (If actual signal phasing and ti mings are us ed, phasing diagrams and ti me charts shoul d be provide under separate cover to PW&T).
>
> If the intersection level of analysis is being performed, existing intersection turning movement counts for the time period(s) analyzed should be included for each intersection. The counts should be presented in such a fashion mat the PW&T staff may determine the peak traffic hour for the tim e period(s) analyzed. In addition expected peak hour turni ng movement counts should also be provided for each critical intersection for the total build condition. If the project is to be const ructed in phases, expect ed peak hour turning movements should be provided for each phase. A sam ple turning movement summary sheet is provided in Appendix D, Figure 2. This ex ample provides a summary of all data required to determine the expected peak hour turning movements.
>
> It is also requested that copies of the original tu rning movement field sheets be provided, under separated cover, to the PW&T st aff. It is requested that th ese counts be summari zed in 15 minute intervals. The purpose of this request is to devel op a histori cal turning movement count file throughout Jefferson County. This data will be useful in m ore accurately determining the impacts of future development in the area and provide Jefferson County and devel opers with an accessi ble traffic count dat abase. The recommendation for the installation of a traffic control signal and the es timated cost for installation should be presented within the text of the report, with other recommended improvements.
>
> If the petitioner or the consultant feels that the insta llation of a new traffic cont rol signal is w arranted, documentation supporting this recommendation should be provided in the a ppendix. This documentation should include a discussion of the signal warra nt expected to be satisf ied and the methodology used in that determination. This nar rative should be supported w ith tables and figures that clearly present any assumptions, calculations and results used in the analysis. Reference material used for this analysi s should also be noted
>
> In addition, possibilities of providing an interconnect signal system or to provide optimum signal progression should be discussed. Figure 3 of Appendix D provides an example of the type of table that should be present in this analysis to support the justification of signal installation.

> Vehicle emissions per mile and idle emissions per minute from results of MO BILE 5a and MOBILE 4 .1c (version of 4 Nov 91) model runs as prepared by AP CDJC personnel to reflect reas onable predictions of future emissions rates. MOBILE 5a model default registration distribution is used. RVP of local gasoline is set to 15.0 as a realistic winter supply condition. The temperature used by the model was 28.5 degrees Fahrenheit, determined to be th e average mini mum daily temper ature for January 1992, and refl ects reasonable expectations of real-world low temperatures (CO emissions go up when temperature goes down).
>
> The model assumed that an i nspection/maintenance program equivalent to the EPA minimum performance-based standard is implemented for all vehicles in the area for all year s. This specification does not take into account local i mprovements over title minimum I/M program but is realistic and m eaningful, since the Clean Air Act manda tes the minimum specification or better in all covered areas, and thus emission rates should be NO HIGHER than those shown. Using the minimum standard allows f or more stable predictions of the future, since as-yet-undetermined program variations are ignored.
>
> These assumptions should be adequate for the inte nded purpose of evaluating individual land-use or transportation projects. Only changes in the MOBILE m odel version should bring about a need to revise t hese rate tables.

> **Purpose & Intent**
>
> The location and type of transit amenities to be provided with various developments depends primarily on three factors: the
>
> planned use of the development, the scope of the development and the presence of transit service in the area. Other contributing factors include surrounding land uses, character of the neighborhood, environmental, and / or topographic factors. This appendix is not intended to dictate where transit facilities are to be installed. Rather, it is designed to ensure that all developments are accessible by any means of transport and that all developments provide a physical place for transit passengers to access the transit vehicle and their final destination. These needs are especially crucial for young people, the elderly, and people with disabilities. In addition to the surrounding environment, transit amenities need to be sited based on service demands and transit agency policies. All of these factors are to be considered when locating a transit amenity.
>
> **Transit Amenities**
>
> Transit amenities are define d as physical de sign features that assist in the provision of transit service. They are to be considered part of the property as a p arking lot or si dewalk in fron t of the building would be and maintenance should be
>
> provided as it is for those areas. The amenities are provided to ensure that transit patrons and other pedestrians have a safe, accessible, and pleasant place to board a tran sit vehicle and travel to a nd from the boarding area t o the building. Larger
>
> developments or developments of a certai n use may warrant the provision of additional amenities at the boarding area,
>
> including, but not limited to, seats, shelte rs, park-n-ride spaces, bicycle storage, trash cans, and increased lighting. Som e developments, based on size, scale, or use, may require on-site transit access to be determined by transit agency and Planning and Design Services. For this appendix, specific transit amenities are defined:
>
> **Boarding Area** – a safe , accessible, thirty-two (32) square foot minimum concrete pad (or pavers) that has a well- marked link from the main entrance of the building to the street th at is free fro m physical obstructions and has minimal conflicts with vehicular traffic. Tran sit agency and Public Works will determine when and specifically where the transit sign will be located. In all cases, the transit agency will work with the developer and Public Works as needed to best configure the necessary details and specifications of the boarding area.
>
> **Boarding Area with seats and shelter** – Boarding Area features and a place for seating and a covered waiting area to protect from the elements. Shelters or awnings and benches are the most common elements, but a more c reative design concept may be allowed based on approval by the Planning Director and Executive Director of transit agency (or designees).
>
> **Additional Review Needed -** Certain developments based on size, scale, or particular use may warrant additional review by the Planning Director and Executive Director of the transit agency (or designees.) The additional review will be use d to determ ine the num ber of park and ride spaces from the size of parking lot, to determine if on-site transit access i s necessary, to determ ine if there a re any special nee ds for tra nsit service for that site , to determine whether pull-off lanes are ne eded, or to decrease the requirem ent. Additiona l review shall take into account the existing character of the roadway in which an amenity may be located.
>
> **Transit Amenities to be provided (or verification of adequate existing facilities for a new development) based on Use** Any development should provide at m inimum a boarding a rea to provide access for em ployees, or a ny persons with disabilities that may need to access the site. Additional requirements are outlined below.
