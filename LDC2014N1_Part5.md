> **4.1.3 LIGHTING**
>
> A. Purpose and Intent
>
> The purpose of this section is to appropriately regulate outdoor lighting in
>
> Louisville and Jefferson County to reduce the effects of light trespass and glare, provide clear guidelines for the installation of outdoor lighting to maintain and compliment the community’s character, and to provide a safe nighttime environment for pedestrians, motorists, and properties. This regulation will implement the following Cornerstone 2020
>
> Community Form Strategy Goals and Objectives: A3.1, A3.4, B2.6, C2.5, C4.6, D4.3, E2.4, E4.3, F4.4, G2.4, G4.3, H2.5, and H4.3.
>
> It is the intent of this regulation to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Jefferson County by regulating the placement, hours of operation, orientation, distribution patterns, intensity, and fixture types of all outdoor lighting used for the illumination outside the public right-of-way while encouraging lighting that conserves energy, reduces light pollution, and enhances nighttime enjoyment of the property within the County, without decreasing safety, utility, security, and productivity.
>
> The following definitions are not a part of this Chapter, but are included to allow for the review of this Part without referring to other portions of this Land Development Code.
>
> *Direct Light* = light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.
>
> *Fixture* = the assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens.
>
> *Flood Light* = a form of lighting fixture designed to direct the output of a contained lamp in a more-or-less specific direction, utilizing reflecting or refracting elements located external to the lamp.
>
> *Footcandle* = the unit of illuminance on a surface one square foot in area on which there is a uniformly distributed flux of one lumen, or the illuminance produced on a surface all points of which are at a distance of one foot from a directionally uniform point source of one candela.
>
> *Fully-Shielded Light Fixture (also known as Full-cutoff)* = a lighting fixture constructed in such a manner that all light emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction from any part of the luminaire, is projected below the horizontal and meets IESNA criteria for fully-shielded (or full-cutoff) fixtures. Any structural part of the light fixture controlling light emissions must be permanently affixed.
>
> *Glare* = light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.
>
> *Height of Luminaire* = the height of a luminaire shall be the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.
>
> *Indirect Light* = direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.
>
> *Lamp* = the component of a luminaire that produces the actual light. *Landscaping Lighting* = type of outdoor lighting used to illuminate
>
> landscaping areas (flower beds, trees, vegetation) and other aesthetic features on a parcel (flag poles, etc.).
>
> *Light Trespass* = the shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.
>
> *Lumen* = a unit of luminous flux. One footcandle is one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of this Regulation, the lumen-output values shall be the INITIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.
>
> *Luminaire* = a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture (*See Appendix 4A for examples of acceptable luminaires*).
>
> *Outdoor Lighting* = the night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means. This includes luminaires used to illuminate advertising signs, landscaping, architectural features, walkways, driveways and parking areas.
>
> *Sag-lens or Drop-lens* = a clear or prismatic refracting lens that extends below the lowest opaque portion of a light fixture.
>
> *Shielded (also known as cutoff) Light Fixture* = a lighting fixture constructed in such a manner that no more than 2.5 percent of the lamp lumens, either directly from the lamp or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction from any part of the luminaire, are not emitted above the horizontal plane through the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.
>
> *Spotlight* = a lighting assembly designed to direct the output of a contained lamp in a specific tightly focused direction (a beam) with a reflector located external to the lamp.
>
> *Temporary Outdoor Lighting* = the specific illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means for a period of less than 15 days, with at least 180 days passing before being used again.
>
> *Uniformity Ratio* = the relationship between the average level of illumination and the lowest level of illumination for a given area. For example, if the uniformity ratio is 3:1 and the average illumination of an area is 3.0 footcandles, then the lowest level of illumination allowed in the given area would be 1.0 footcandles.
>
> B. Regulations
>
> 1. All public and private outdoor lighting shall be in conformance with the requirements established by this Regulation.
>
> 2. Control of Glare – Luminaire Design Factors
>
> a. All luminaires shall be aimed, directed, or focused such as to not cause direct light from the luminaire to be directed toward residential uses or protected open spaces (i.e., conservation easements, greenways, parkways) on adjacent or nearby parcels, or to create glare perceptible to persons operating motor vehicles on public streets and right-of-way.
>
> b. The following items shall apply to the mounting height of luminaires:
>

> supplying to the office copies of all state and local applications and permits prior to the relocation procedure.
>
> 2. Notification: The applicant shall notify the Jefferson County Office of Historic Preservation and Archives and the Kentucky Historical Society of the location of any cemetery or burial ground prior to development or subdivision of the parcel.
>
> 3. In preserving a cemetery while at the same time developing a parcel, an applicant, property owner, or developer has the following options:
>
> a. Transfer the existing cemetery as part of a buildable lot.
>
> Ownership and maintenance of the cemetery shall be transferred to the individual lot owner.

***NOTE:** The procedure for the removal and relocation of a cemetery is set out in*

*KRS 381.720 -*

*KRS 381.767.*

> b. Make the existing cemetery a separate lot permanently preserved from development of structures or other non- cemetery improvements. Ownership and maintenance of the cemetery shall be transferred by written agreement to either a subdivision Homeowner's Association, a local legislative unit, or an historical organization. A legally created transfer agreement must be finalized and executed, and a copy provided to DPDS, within 90 days of any final approval of a
>
> record plat or development plan. The Planning Commission or its designee may grant up to two thirty-day extensions for the execution of said transfer agreement. Failure to execute the agreement or provide the copy may render the final approval of a subdivision plan or district development plan null and void.
>
> c. The applicant shall inform the Planning Commission which of the above listed options they choose to pursue prior to approval of any development or subdivision.
>
> 4. Building Setbacks
>
> a. For cemeteries with defined boundaries (such as a wall or fence), all buildings and structures other than fences and walls shall be set back at least 30 feet from the perimeter. Land disturbance within 30 feet of the perimeter except as described in number 6 below shall not be allowed. Prior to initiating any site disturbing activities and for the duration of the site preparation and construction processes, the 30-foot buffer area shall be delineated by installation of temporary fencing so as to be readily identifiable.
>
> b. For cemeteries with undefined boundaries, the Commission may require certification of a cemetery with undefined boundaries by an archaeologist (as defined in 36 CFR Part 61). Documentation of acceptance of the cemetery boundaries by the Historic Landmarks Commission or delegated staff persons shall be provided for Planning Commission and building permit agency files prior to initiation of any site disturbance activities. After the boundary has been approved, all buildings and structures other than fences and walls shall be set back at
>
> least 30 feet, or another distance set by the Jefferson County
>
> Historic Landmarks Commission.
>
> 5. Security: Existing cemetery fences and walls shall be maintained and repaired. The property owner or developer is required to erect a new permanent enclosure (if one does not exist) surrounding the cemetery. For cemeteries with undefined boundaries, the location of the fence shall be established in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Jefferson County
>
> Historic Landmarks Commission. The new permanent fence shall be made of a material compatible with the character of the existing cemetery and surrounding residences. If a portion of an original wall or fence remains, and it is a compatible material (e.g. stone, brick, cast iron, wooden picket) the permanent fence or wall shall be properly repaired using the same material. If the existing fence is an inappropriate material (e.g. barbed wire or farm fence), it
>
> shall be replaced with a new fence of an appropriate material. Although the permanent fence must be erected as soon as practical, a temporary fence must be erected and maintained at all times during site development and construction. The Jefferson County Historic Landmarks Commission shall be responsible for determining the appropriateness of materials.
>
> 6. Maintenance: Existing cemetery planting or foliage shall be pruned and generally left in its natural state. The Jefferson County Historic Landmarks Commission shall be responsible for determining the appropriateness of landscaping used in and
>
> immediately surrounding all inactive cemeteries. Cemeteries shall be maintained both during site development and after construction is complete in accordance with Chapter 96 of the Jefferson
>
> County Code of Ordinances.
>
> 7. Public access shall be provided and permanently maintained to an existing cemetery with a minimum 15-foot recorded ingress-
>
> egress access easement.
>
> 8. A statement by the property owner, applicant, or developer shall be made on the site plan or subdivision plan regarding permanent cemetery ownership and maintenance. This information shall also be included on a Final Plat for a subdivision if recorded after the effective date of this regulation.
>
> 9. A deed restriction in a form approved by the Planning Commission legal counsel shall be recorded acknowledging the location, site, ownership, and maintenance of a cemetery.
>
> 10. Yard Requirements: No area occupied by graves may be counted toward the area required for front, side, street-side or rear yard requirements.
>
> 11. If human remains are discovered during the excavation or development of a site the applicant shall immediately cease excavation activities and notify the Jefferson County Coroner and the Jefferson County Historic Landmarks Commission.
>
> **4.4.7 MINOR EARTH EXCAVATIONS**
>
> A. On land in any zone, at the option of the property owner, a minor earth excavation not constituting a quarry, borrow pit or commercial operation, and/or filling of land with non-combustible, inorganic materials may be performed without a conditional use permit where all of the following con- ditions are met and agreed to:
>
> 1. The operation is performed in compliance with a plan which has received approval of the agency responsible for surface drainage/storm water drainage and from the Planning Director of the agency that provides staffing to the Planning Commission which may include provisions relating to bonding, remedies for violations, and correction of problems not anticipated at the time of approval. Approval by the responsible governmental officials shall be based on a finding that the plan complies with the Erosion
>
> Prevention and Sediment Control ordinance and that it will not likely result in unreasonable inconvenience, annoyance, or harm of any nature to the public, nearby property, or environmental features (i.e. karst features, streams) because of circumstances associated with the area or the operation.
>
> 2. Earthfills shall be permitted when the volume does not exceed
>
> 1,500 cubic yards for each acre to be filled or 250 total cubic yards of fill material, whichever limit is less restrictive. Excavations shall be permitted when the volume does not exceed 750 cubic yards of excavated material for each acre excavated or 100 total cubic yards of excavated material, whichever limit is less restrictive. An earthfill or excavation which exceeds the restrictions of this paragraph may be permitted if the earthfill or excavation is for a foundation of a structure or structures or other development which has (have) received all necessary Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Adjustment, and other government approvals and permits.
>
> 3. The filling or excavation shall be completed and the area involved shall be stabilized and re-vegetated in accordance with the approved plan within nine (9) months of approval of the plan. Refer to Chapter 4 Part 12 Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control for specific site stabilization standards.
>
> 4. Fill materials are limited to clean (or uncontaminated) sand, clay, silt, gravel, soil, or other non-polluting, inorganic, non-combustible material approved by the Metropolitan Sewer District or successor.
>
> 5. Failure to comply with the approved plan or the violation of any order of any reviewing governmental official relating to the operation shall constitute a violation of these regulations resulting in the imposition of penalties set out in Part 11.10 in addition to all other appropriate remedies agreed to in the plan or otherwise allowed by law.
>
> This exception is made primarily for the purpose of reducing frequently unnecessary delay caused by the strict enforcement of Section 4.2.22, and the exclusive remedy for any property owner complaining of an action or order of a reviewing governmental official relating to the operation shall be to seek a conditional use permit from the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with Section 4.2.22.

> Commentary: This section provides incentives for developers who provide open space, housing that reinforces income diversity, and other community benefits in keeping with the goals of Cornerstone 2020. In brief, in return for these community benefits, this section will permit developers to reduce lot sizes in subdivisions and more closely approximate the allowable density under the applicable zoning district regulations. The greater the benefits offered, the higher the density allowed, within the limit established by the site’s zoning classification.

> 3. The area of the site to which development potential is being transferred is at least as large as the area from which development potential is being transferred (for example; if an applicant wishes to transfer development potential from 3 acres, the portion of the site to which development is shifted must be at least 3 acres); and,
>
> 4. All lots in the proposed development meet the minimum alternative development incentive lot size of the applicable Form District; and,
>
> 5. All lots in the proposed development meet the height, yard and setback requirements of the applicable Form District.
>
> B. The maximum development potential allowable for transfer shall be determined by one of the following methods:
>
> 1. One half of the theoretical development potential based on the number of acres preserved and the existing zoning of the area to be preserved (for example; if 3 acres of an R-4 site is proposed for protection, then 7 building sites could be transferred to other portions of the same property - 3ac x 4.84 units/acre / 2 = 7.26 units); or,

**Conditional Use Table**

> The following table is a summary of the conditional use lists for each of the zoning districts. It is included with the Land Development Code to facilitate use of the detailed information found in Chapter 4 of the Code. This table is intended to help you determine the appropriate zoning district for a given conditional use. It summarizes and simplifies the information found in Chapter 4; it does not replace Chapter 4. Once you have determined the zones which allow a conditional use, it is necessary to consult Chapter 4 for a complete description of the use and possible restrictions on the use.
>
> In using the table, please keep in mind the following points:
>
> • The table is a guide to users, it is not an officially adopted part of the Land Development Code
>
> • The conditional use lists of Chapter 4 always take precedence over this table.
>
> • In some instances, certain jurisdictions within the County have modified the conditional use lists; refer to Chapter 4 to ensure that a use is conditional at a particular location.
>
> • This table will be updated periodically; refer to the web site for the most recent version including recent staff interpretations (http://www.loukymetro.org; choose “County” then “Departments”, then “Planning and Design Services” then “New Land Development Code.”)
>
> Key: C = Conditional use, may be granted in the district after a public hearing
>
> **Appendix 4F – Conditional Uses**
>
> ***Please refer to Chapter 4 of the Land Development Code for more information regarding these conditional uses.***
