> The intent of this Part is to protect, conserve, preserve and replace trees in order to enhance community character, provide wildlife habitat, maintain air and water quality, decrease stormwater runoff, prevent soil erosion, provide noise buffers, and enhance property values. This Part is also intended to provide several alternative means to the Planning Commission to further the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan by providing for flexible tree canopy requirements subject, however, to specified standards and findings. Tree canopy standards shall be met on site to the maximum extent feasible and tree preservation is the preferred means of accomplishing canopy objectives.
>
> *The following terms relating to Tree Canopy are included in the Definitions (Chapter 1 Part 2): *Caliper*, *Dripline*, *Tree* *Canopy*, *Tree, Type A*, *Tree, Type B*, *Tree, Type C**
>
> **10.1.1 Relationship to the Comprehensive Plan**
>
> The tree canopy regulations prescribed by this Part are intended to implement the following Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive Plan Goals and Plan Elements.

| **Goals**                                  | **Plan Elements**      |

| Livability Strategy Goals F2; F3; F4; G4   | Guidelines 3, 10, 13   |

> **10.1.2 Applicability and Basis of Calculation**
>
> A. The requirements of this Part shall apply to all new residential subdivisions creating more than five (5) buildable lots and to all new multi-family and nonresidential development. New single-family residential construction shall provide tree(s) in accordance with the residential design standards found within chapter 5.
>
> B. Expansion or reconstruction of an existing nonresidential building or development shall be subject to the requirements of this Part as follows:
>
> 1. Any development site on which there is an increase in building area or impervious surface area by **more than fifty (50) percent**
>
> or where a structure has been demolished and a new structure has
>
> been built in its place shall fully comply with the tree canopy requirements set forth in this Part.
>
> 2. Any development site on which there is an increase in building area or impervious surface area by **more than twenty (20) percent and less than fifty (50) percent** shall provide one-half (1/2) the tree canopy required by this Part.
>
> 3. Any development site on which there is an increase in building area or impervious surface area by twenty (20) percent or less shall not be required to provide the tree canopy required by this
>
> Part. ***Note:** This*

*provision*

> C. The requirements of this Part shall apply to the entire area shown
>
> on a development plan and the required canopy may be equally distributed throughout that area or be concentrated in certain parts or portions of that area.
>
> **10.1.3 Alternatives for Compliance**
>
> The tree canopy requirements of this Part may be satisfied at the applicant’s discretion by any combination of the following means.
>
> A. Preservation of existing trees or tree stands on the development site.
>
> B. Planting new trees on the development site or as street trees on adjacent rights-of-way.
>
> C. Planting new trees on an alternative site approved by the Planning
>
> Commission, at the applicant’s expense.
>
> The Planning Commission may approve an alternative site for the planting of an equivalent number/amount of trees that meets any one of the following criteria: (1) a site within a public park approved by the Metropolitan Parks Department; (2) a site on a public road right-of-way, not adjacent to the development site, approved by the Director of Works or by the appropriate state or federal official in the event that the site is on a state or federal road; (3) a privately developed site upon which affordable housing has been constructed or is to be
>
> constructed; and (4) a site of existing development where the Planning Commission finds that additional tree canopy would be in the public interest. In any such case, the Planning Commission may condition its approval of an alternative site upon the agreement of the applicant to plant a tree or trees of a type that is deemed appropriate for the site. It should be noted that using an alternative site to meet the tree canopy requirements is an option available to developers that must be approved by the Planning Commission. In no case shall the Planning Commission require the off-site planting of trees to meet the requirements of this Part.
>
> **10.1.4 Tree Canopy Standards**
>
> A. The tree canopy on a development site shall meet the applicable standards according to the site’s form district, proposed land use and the amount of tree preservation, as set forth in Tables 10.1.1 and 10.1.2, below. (Percentages refer to the relation of tree canopy to gross site area in square feet.)

*(10.1.2, C) allows residential subdivisions and multi-lot commercial developments to group trees in clusters throughout the development rather than meeting the canopy requirements on a lot-by-lot basis.*

> C. Preservation of existing tree canopy in excess of the cover specified in Tables 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 and retention of trees in sensitive natural areas are encouraged. However, removal of existing tree canopy that covers a greater percentage of the site than stipulated in the minimum standards set forth above is permissible unless restricted by an approved development or subdivision plan or by other applicable provisions of this Land Development Code.
>
> D. Any tree preserved or planted to meet the minimum requirements of this Part shall be maintained in healthy condition and shall be replaced if it becomes diseased or dies.
>
> E. The Planning Director may require that any trees and/or tree stands preserved to meet the requirements of this Part be inspected and found to be healthy and free of disease by a certified arborist or registered landscape architect if, upon inspection of the site, he/she or his/her designee sees evidence that indicates that some or all of said trees may be unhealthy and may not be appropriate for preservation.
>
> F. When trees are planted off-site or on private property to meet the requirements of this Part, the applicant shall provide the Planning Director with documentation that sufficient measures have been taken to ensure the preservation and, when necessary, the replacement of said trees. Examples of such measures would include, but not be limited to, including preservation and replacement provisions in a subdivision’s deed of restrictions or within a development’s binding elements or by placing all of the required trees within a conservation easement or a Woodland Protection Area (WPA).
>
> G. What trees are not protected?
>
> All known invasives are not protected and will not be considered toward meeting the tree canopy requirements. However, tree canopy credit will be received (see Table 10.1.3 and 10.1.4 for credit square footage) for the removal of the invasive if it is replaced by a 1 ¾” caliper Type A or Type B tree.

> **10.1.5 Calculation**
>
> A. Any development site greater than two acres in size shall be permitted to determine the area of existing tree canopy coverage to be preserved by ground checking, aerial analysis, or any other method determined to be accurate by DPDS staff. If ground checking is utilized, then each individual tree (i.e. a tree not grouped with other trees or a part of a tree stand) intended to be retained and used to meet the tree canopy requirements herein shall be measured to determine its caliper and the credit given for that tree shall be in accordance with Table 10.1.3, below.

>
> 1. measurement of the trunk to determine its caliper and the credit given for that tree shall be in accordance with Table 10.1.3, below; or
>
> 2. the dripline may be plotted on the site plan and tree canopy credit given for the percentage of the site within the dripline.
>
> C. New trees planted to meet the requirements of this Part shall be given credit in accordance with Table 10.1.3, below. Such trees must meet the standards of Chapter 10 Part 4 at the time of planting.
>
> D. Street trees planted in accordance with Section 10.2.8 shall qualify for a
>
> 25% bonus in the amount of credit listed in Table 10.1.3. This credit shall apply to street trees that are mandated as well as those planted on a voluntary basis.
>
> E. All approved WPAs shall qualify for a 10% bonus in the amount of credit listed in Table 10.1.3.
>
> F. In calculating the required number of trees, fractions less than .5 shall be dropped and greater than or equal to .5 shall be rounded up.

Trees are to be depicted on tree inventory and tree preservation plan with a CRZ circle centered on the tree base location (i.e. a twenty inch diameter tree is represented by a 40 foot diameter circle). The formula is: Tree in inches X 2, then convert to feet = CRZ diameter. The CRZ circles will be shown on the tree inventory and tree preservation plan so that review staff can discern the extent of disturbance proposed near existing trees.

>
> A. *General Requirements*: Property Perimeter Landscape Buffer Areas shall be applied along all property boundaries of sites affected by this ordinance except for those boundaries adjacent to streets.
>
> Zoning Districts and their associated land uses have been grouped into the following five intensity classes for the purpose of applying property perimeter Landscape Buffer Area requirements; refer to Table 10.2.1.
>
> Table 10.2.1 Intensity Classes and Zoning Districts

*STEP 1*

*Determine intensity class for the proposed use and adjacent sites.*

> 1-These Zoning Districts have additional landscape and buffering requirements.
>
> CUP sites located in a residential zoning district shall provide buffering as per the requirements for uses permitted in the C-1 Zoning District, or alternative buffering and landscaping as approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
>
> Exceptions to the buffering requirements can be found in Section 10.2.5
>
> All development subject to this Part, as defined in Section 10.2.2, shall provide Landscape Buffer Areas and plantings as defined in Tables
>
> 10.2.2, 10.2.3 and 10.2.4. Associated with each Landscape Buffer Area requirement is a planting density requirement. The planting density requirement indicates the minimum amount of landscape material to be provided within each Landscape Buffer Area to ensure an appropriate screen.

> Table 10.2.4 Planting Density and Screening

*Step 4*

> *Identify required plantings and screening*
>
> Example: In the Neighborhood Form District, construction of a C-1 retail establishment (Intensity Class 4) is proposed adjacent to the R-4 district (Intensity Class 1). A “C.4” buffer is required. A 35 foot buffer strip, 8 foot screening fence and 3 large trees per 100 feet of perimeter are required. The developer has the option of decreasing the buffer to 25 feet, and increasing the number of trees to 4.5 per 100 feet of common boundary with the R-4 property. If the site were in the Traditional Neighborhood Form, the developer would have the option of a 15 foot buffer, with 4.5 trees per 100 feet.

*Appendix 10A classifies tree species as type A, B, or C*

> B. *Explanatory Text and Exceptions:* Property perimeter Landscape Buffer Areas may contain walks, trails, or other similar elements, provided that the required plant material (as defined in the part to follow) is not eliminated and the Landscape Buffer Area is at least 25 feet wide. Property perimeter Landscape Buffer Areas shall be free from all other development including buildings, parking, driveways or other structures except those attendant to public utility service within a dedicated *easement*. Outdoor storage or stockpiling of materials is not permitted within property perimeter Landscape Buffer Areas*.*

*Retaining walls are not permitted within a required*

> Utility easements (e.g., drainage, sewer, gas/electric) are allowed to encroach into as much as 50% of the required width of property perimeter Landscape Buffer Areas provided the required screening can still be achieved and the design of such facilities is compatible with the purpose of the Landscape Buffer Area. If work is required within the

> easements causing removal or damage of landscape materials (including any required fences, walls or berms), the property owner shall be responsible for replacement of materials according to the approved landscape plan. Type ‘C’ trees may be planted under overhead utility lines at a minimum spacing of 1 tree per 30 feet of lineal boundary with approval of utility company to meet perimeter tree planting requirement.
>
> The landscape material and buffer area required generally shall be provided by the property owner of the higher intensity activity. If the higher intensity use is already developed and the landscape material and buffer area, required in Chapter 10 has not been provided, the lower intensity use shall provide the required landscaping. If the requirements

> **10.5.3 Amount of Open Space Credit**
>
> The amount of credit provided towards the fulfillment of an open space requirement or incentive for the various forms of open space depends upon its level of accessibility to the public and the development potential of the land
>
> itself. When calculating the amount of credit a particular open space area should be given the following shall apply.
>
> A. Credit equal to 125% of the open space area shall be given for any open space area that is permanently preserved as Public Open Space, except as prescribed in (D) of this Section.
>
> B. Credit equal to 100% of the open space area shall be given for any open space area that is permanently preserved as Common Open Space, except as prescribed in (D) of this Section.
>
> C. Credit equal to 75% of the open space area shall be given for any open space area that is permanently preserved as Private Open Space, except as prescribed in (D) of this Section and except that no credit shall be
>
> given for private open space areas where easements or development rights have been purchased or acquired through the use of public funds.
>
> D. Requirements of this paragraph D. shall only apply to sites that are developed in accordance with Section 2.7.3 (Planned Residential Development District) or Chapter 4 Part 5 (Alternative Development Incentives). Open space that is located in an area in which development is prohibited or is significantly restricted due to environmental constraints or other conditions shall be given partial open space credit in an effort to ensure their permanent preservation. These areas and the open space credit they shall receive are prescribed below.
>
> 1. Conveyance zones (50% credit)
>
> 2. Jurisdictional wetlands (50% credit)
>
> In order for any of the areas mentioned above to qualify as open space and receive the open space credit prescribed herein, they must meet the open space standards set forth in Section 10.5.4. When an open space credit is prescribed by (D) of this Section, the amount of credit provided shall be calculated by multiplying the open space area by the credit (%) provided in (D) and then by multiplying that total by the credit (%) provided for the various
>
> types of preservation (e.g. public, common or private).
>
> **10.5.4 Open Space Standards**
>
> Because of the variety in the types and functions of open space demonstrated in Section 10.5.2, specific requirements are needed that permit the location, design and use of open space to be consistent with its intended purpose. As such the following standards have been developed for specific open space types and uses. Any area designated as open space shall be categorized and labeled on the face of the applicable plan (e.g. preliminary subdivision, development plan, final site plan, or landscape plan) according to the type of open space and the standards for that type of open space shall be applicable.
>
> A. Standards for All Types of Open Space
>
> 1. Any area covered by or contained within any of the following shall not be considered as open space unless specifically permitted: buildings, streets, public or private rights-of-way, parking areas,

***Note:** Partial credit for open space as specified in*

*10.5.3.D is not applicable to any required open space (e.g., Campus, Village form districts.)*

> utility rights-of-way (except where all utilities are required to be underground).
>
> 2. Parking lots may not be used to meet an open space requirement or incentive unless they are designed as part of the open space and are intended primarily for users of the open space (e.g., parking for sports field, greenway or park users). Semi-pervious
>
> paving systems shall be required when any parking lot proposed to be used as open space contains more than 20 parking spaces.
>
> 3. All parklands or other open space intended for dedication to public use must be approved as to location and design by the public entity proposed to be responsible for managing the open space prior to plan approval by the Planning Commission or DPDS.
>
> 4. All open space areas other than those provided for developments in the Downtown Form District shall have a minimum dimension of
>
> 30 feet and contain at least 6,000 square feet of contiguous area.
>
> A minimum dimension of no less than 15 feet may be permitted for pedestrian facilities that connect other open space areas within a site. When a site’s open space requirement is less than 6,000 square feet the minimum area may be reduced to equal that requirement.
>
> 5. When an area is preserved as **private open space**, prior to the recording of a plat or the issuance of a building permit, whichever occurs first, the developer and recipient entity shall submit a copy of the recorded conservation easement assuring the permanent protection, preservation and maintenance of the proposed open space. If such documents are not provided, the open space area shall not be considered for the purposes of meeting required open space nor shall it be used to calculate any potential open space credit provided by the Land Development Code.
>
> 6. When an area is preserved as **common open space**, prior to the recording of a plat or the issuance of a building permit, whichever occurs first, the developer and, where applicable, recipient entity shall submit a copy of the recorded documents assuring the permanent protection, preservation and maintenance of the proposed open space. If such documents are not provided, the open space area shall not be considered for the purposes of meeting required open space nor shall it be used to calculate any potential open space credit provided by the Land Development Code. (See Chapter 1 for specific maintenance requirements for common open space and common facilities.)
>
> 7. When an area is preserved as **public open space**, the Planning Director shall review the proposed open space and determine, upon consultation with the Parks Director, if it is accessible by and a benefit to the general public. Prior to the recording of a plat or the issuance of a building permit, whichever occurs first, the
>
> developer shall permanently dedicate the open space to public use in a manner acceptable to the Planning Commission and the recipient entity.
>
> B. Standards for Outdoor Recreation
>
> 1. All open space for outdoor recreation shall be preserved as either common or public open space.
>
> 2. All open space located within a site shall be integrated and connected with any part of an adjacent and designated park, open space or greenway.
>
> 3. Squares and greens shall not be located behind dwellings. The Planning Director may allow exceptions to this standard upon determining that topography, existing street layout, or other features make this restriction impractical.
>
> 4. All pedestrian and bicycle corridors used to meet an open space requirement or incentive may not be located in a public right-of- way, shall be at least 30 feet in width, and the paths and trails located within them must be designed to the standards contained or incorporated by reference in the *KIPDA Regional Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan*.
>
> C. Standards for Natural Resource Protection / Public Health and Safety
>
> Purposes
>
> 1. Greenways designated within and meeting the design standards of *a* legislatively adopted greenways plan or subsequent watershed master plan may be utilized to meet an open space requirement or incentive.
>
> 2. Jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional wetlands and their buffers may be used to satisfy an open space requirement or incentive if the hydrologic and vegetative character of the wetland is maintained in a pre-development condition. This shall not preclude increasing the volume of water or rate in which it passes through the wetland when the wetland is being used as a water quality filter and said
>
> modifications would not degrade the quality of the existing wetland. It shall also not preclude increasing the size of the wetland or enhancing its existing vegetation.
>
> 3. Detention and retention basins may be counted towards an open space requirement or incentive as follows.
>
> a. Retention basins designed to hold water at least five feet in depth on a continuous basis throughout the year may be used to meet an open space requirement or incentive if its banks are vegetated and landscaping is provided around the basin’s perimeter in an effort to make it a visual amenity for the development and the basin is accessible by the provision of walking paths or other pedestrian facilities.
>
> b. Detention basins may be used to meet an open space requirement or incentive if some form of outdoor recreation is incorporated into its design (e.g., walking paths, tennis courts, basketball courts and similar facilities within the basin). The frequency and duration of standing water in these basins shall

> not be such that proposed outdoor recreation use is practically restricted on a regular basis. The applicant shall address provision of maintenance necessary to allow the use of these areas. Landscaping should be provided around the basin’s perimeter in an effort to make it a visual amenity for the development and its banks should be vegetated. The basins should also be accessible by the provision of walking paths or other pedestrian facilities. When access is provided within a basin the maximum grade of the pedestrian facilities shall be
>
> 12.5%.
>
> 4. Areas with significant karst geology may be used to satisfy an open space requirement or incentive if sufficient area, inclusive of buffers, is preserved as open space in order to protect the geologic, hydrologic or vegetative character of the area.
>
> 5. Unstable soils as depicted by *Core Graphic 5: “Environmental Constraints”* may be utilized to meet an open space requirement or incentive.
>
> D. Standards for Aesthetic, Design Compatibility, Cultural, Educational
>
> Purposes
>
> 1. Any roadway median that is intended to be used to satisfy an open space requirement or incentive shall be at least 30 feet in width
>
> and provide a landscape treatment including at least one large Type A tree per 50 linear feet of road frontage and some combination of shrubs and ground cover. Where pedestrian facilities/crossings are provided, they shall be designed and installed in accordance with current Public Works standards.
>
> 2. Cultural, historic or archaeological sites proposed to satisfy an open space requirement or incentive must be either locally designated as a Historic Landmarks Preservation District, must be located within the National Register Historic District, or be listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The sites must be permanently preserved through easement or other form of dedication, and provisions agreed upon to secure the permanent maintenance and preservation of the sites. Open space credit provided in accordance with this provision shall not include any building or structure.
>
> 3. When a structure or group of structures are proposed adjacent to a designated scenic corridor, open space shall be credited for providing a structure setback from the scenic corridor at least 50% greater than that required. Upon providing the additional setback the entire setback, including that which is required, may be
>
> credited as open space as long as that area is permanently preserved as open space.
>
> 4. Landscape Buffer Areas (LBA’s) required by this Land Development Code that exceed 40 feet in depth and that are permanently protected as open space may be used in their entirety to meet an open space requirement or qualify for an open space incentive.

*Note: If a 30’ buffer area is required, it must be supplemented by 10 additional feet in order to receive credit as open space.*

> E. Standards for the Managed Production of Resources
>
> 1. A maximum of 75% of any open space requirement or incentive may be satisfied by lands that are permanently preserved for Managed Production of Resources.
>
> **10.5.5 Transfer of Open Space Provisions**
>
> Where a portion of this Land Development Code requires open space or allows an incentive for the provision of open space and specifically allows for the transfer of that open space, then the owner/developer may choose to transfer a portion of an open space requirement or incentive to an off-site location subject to final approval by the Planning Commission or its designee. Any transfer will be subject to the following conditions and limitations.
>
> A. The following limitations shall apply to the amount of an open space requirement or incentive that may be transferred.

> Acres………………………………………………..………..……40%
>
> B. The minimum increment of open space to be transferred shall be one acre.
>
> C. The transfer of open space must be made to an off-site location that is within two miles of the site from which it is being transferred unless said open space is public open space, in which case the off-site location must be within either (1) two miles of the site from which it is being transferred or (2) the same *Recreation Planning Service Area* (as defined by the *Parks and Open Space Master Plan*). In any case the transfer of open space shall be subject to final approval by the Planning Commission or
>
> its designee.
>
> D. The transfer of open space must be provided in the form of a conservation easement owned or managed by a qualified holder or by dedication to the Parks Department or other governmental entity.
>
> E. A preliminary letter of interest on behalf of a qualified holder, the Parks Department, or other governmental entity must be completed and submitted concurrently with any application for plan review that would trigger the open space requirement or incentive. A legally created transfer agreement must be finalized and executed, and a copy provided to DPDS, within 90 days of any final approval of a plan submittal. The Planning Commission or its designee may grant up to two thirty-day extensions for the execution of said transfer agreement. Failure to

LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE

10C-7

> **TREE PRESERVATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES**
>
> Revised October 22, 2009
>
> The following language has been prepared by staff to clarify both the intent and application of Planning & Design Services’ tree preservation policy.
>
> **Intent**
>
> Tree preservation measures should address three objectives: permanent protection for existing trees/tree masses that have been designated to meet the Tree Canopy requirements of Chapter 10 Part 1; permanent protection for existing
>
> trees/tree masses that are required to preserved by binding element; and
>
> temporary protection during development of infrastructure to allow individual property owners the opportunity to incorporate existing trees into their building
>
> sites. To differentiate between these three intents, the following three designations are in effect and are described in this policy:
>
> **Tree Canopy Protection Area (TCPA) Woodland Protection Area (WPA) Tree Preservation Area (TPA)**
>
> *For the purposes of this policy, “development plans” refers to preliminary subdivisions, general or detailed plans, conditional uses, and rezonings.*
>
> **General Information**
>
> 1. All tree and shrub preservation and protection measures shall be removed upon issuance of Certificate of Occupancy.
>
> 2. The timeframe for Installation of landscape materials shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 10 of the LDC.
>
> *Site Disturbance Permit*
>
> 1. *Site disturbance permits will be issued by MSD **after** MSD receives approval from both Public Works and Planning & Design Services. PDS approval will be a copy of the approved tree preservation plan. Public Works approval will be a plan with the “Transportation” approval stamp.*
>
> 2. Tree preservation fencing, tree canopy calculations, trees being preserved must be shown on the clearing and grading and site disturbance plan.
>
> 3. Prior to any site disturbance permit being issued and Prior to any clearing, grading or the issuance of a site disturbance permit, a site inspection shall be conducted by PDS staff to ensure proper placement of required tree protection fencing in accordance with the approved Tree Preservation Plan.
>
> TREE CANOPY PROTECTION AREA (TCPA)
>
> **Description:**
>
> Tree Canopy Protection Areas (TCPAs) are individual trees and/or groupings of trees (trees may be existing or proposed) designated to meet the Tree Canopy requirements of Chapter 10 Part 1of the Land Development Code (LDC), and to be **permanently protected\***. TCPAs shall be clearly designated on approved development plans by location.
>
> No structures shall be closer than 15 feet to the Limit of Disturbance (Tree Protection Fence) protecting a TCPA. No vehicle use area (VUA) shall be closer than 10 feet to the Limit of Disturbance (Tree Protection Fence) protecting a TCPA.
>
> As trees within TCPAs are lost through natural causes, new trees shall be planted in order to maintain minimum tree canopy as specified on the approved development plan.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> All development plans showing TCPAs to seek credit for preservation of existing trees to meet tree canopy requirements shall submit and receive approval of a tree preservation plan in accordance with section 10.1.6 of the LDC prior to issuance of any site disturbance permit:
>
> *Information:*
>
> 1. Proposed site plan showing buildings, edges of pavement, property/lot lines, easements, existing topography, and other significant site features (LOJIC topographic information is acceptable).
>
> 2. Preliminary drainage considerations (retention/detention, ditches/large swales, etc.).
>
> 3. Location of all existing trees/tree masses existing on the site (aerial photos or LOJIC maps are acceptable data sources), and delineation of those to
>
> be preserved in TCPAs.
>
> 4. Location of tree protection fencing for each tree/tree mass designated to be protected. Dimension lines shall be provided to establish the general location of tree protection fencing.
>
> 5. Tree Preservation/Protection Signage – All tree protection fences must be accompanied by “Stay Out” and “Tree Protection Area” signage. Size and text of sign will be standardized. See figure 10D.1 below for an example.
>
> Figure 10D.1
>
> TREE PROTECTION SIGN
>
> **CAUTION**
>
> TREE PRESERVATION
>
> CONTRACTOR MUST INSTALL AND MAINTAIN CONSTRUCTION FENCING
>
> *Notes:*
>
> 1. Tree Canopy Protection Areas (TCPAs) identified on this plan represent individual trees and/or portions of the site designated to meet the Tree Canopy requirements of Chapter 10 Part 1of the Land Development Code and are to be permanently protected. All clearing, grading and fill activity in these areas must be in keeping with restrictions established at the time of plan approval. As trees within TCPAs are lost through natural causes, new trees shall be planted in order to maintain minimum tree canopy as specified on the approved development or preliminary subdivision plan.
>
> 2. Dimension lines have been used on this plan to establish the general location of TCPAs and represent minimum distances. The final boundary for each TCPA shall be established in the field to include canopy area of all trees at or within the dimension line.
>
> 3. Tree protection fencing shall be erected adjacent to all TCPAs prior to Site Disturbance Approval to protect the existing tree stands and their root systems. The fencing shall be located at least three (3) feet from the outside edge of the tree canopy and shall remain in place until all construction is completed.
>
> 4. No parking, material storage or construction activities are permitted within the TCPAs.
>
> 5. During all construction activity (includes clearing, grading, building construction and VUA construction) a copy of the approved tree
>
> preservation plan shall be on site.
>
> **TREE PRESERVATION AREA (TPA) Description:**
>
> Tree preservation areas (TPAs) represent those portions of the site to be left undisturbed during development of roadways, utilities and similar infrastructure. TPAs are not permanent preservation areas; clearing, grading and/or removal of trees in TPAs is allowed at the time of individual building or home construction.
>
> Any modification of the tree preservation plan requested by the applicant may be approved by the designated DPDS staff **if** the changes are in keeping with the intent of the approved tree preservation plan.
>
> Trees designated as TPAs only shall not be eligible to count towards Tree Canopy requirements for a development site.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> All development plans showing TPAs shall submit and receive approval for a tree preservation plan in accordance with Chapter 10 Part 4 of the LDC prior to issuance of any site disturbance permit, and shall contain the following information and notes:
>
> *Information:*
>
> 1. Proposed site plan showing buildings, edges of pavement, property/lot lines, easements, existing and proposed contours, and other significant site features (LOJIC topographic information is acceptable).
>
> 2. Preliminary drainage considerations (retention/detention, ditches/large swales, etc.).
>
> 3. Location of all existing trees/tree masses existing on the site (as
>
> shown by aerial photos or LOJIC maps are acceptable data sources).
>
> 4. Location of tree protection fencing for each tree/tree mass designated to be preserved. Dimension lines shall be provided to establish the general location of tree protection fencing.
>
> *Notes:*
>
> 1. Tree preservation areas (TPAs) identified on this plan represent portions of the site the developer has designated to be left undisturbed during the development of roadways, utilities and similar infrastructure. These are not permanent preservation areas. Trees in these areas may be removed during construction of homes or buildings on this site.
>
> 2. Dimension lines have been used on this plan to establish the general location of TPAs and represent minimum distances. The final boundary for each TPA shall be established in the field to include canopy area of all
>
> trees at or within the dimension line.
>
> 3. Tree protection fencing shall be erected adjacent to all TPAs prior to Site Disturbance Approval (Clearing and Grading Permit) to protect the existing tree stands and their root systems. The fencing shall be located at least three (3) feet from the outside edge of the tree canopy and shall remain in place until all construction is completed. When trees must be removed in a TPA, the fence shall be relocated to protect all remaining trees within that TPA. When a tree mass contains both TCPAs/WPAs and TPAs fencing shall only be required at the outer most perimeter of that tree mass.
>
> 4. No parking, material storage or construction activities are permitted within the TPAs beyond that allowed for preliminary site investigation work.
>
> 5. Clearing necessary to provide access for survey work, rock soundings or other usual and customary site investigations shall be permitted prior to
>
> Site Disturbance Approval. Preliminary site investigations shall be carefully planned to minimize the amount of clearing required. Clearing should
>
> follow proposed roadway centerlines and should not result in a clear access way of more than twenty (20) feet in width. Cleared access ways
>
> beyond proposed roadways to assess individual lots shall not exceed twelve (12) feet in width or encroach into any proposed open space lots.
>
> No trees exceeding eight (8) inches in diameter measured at breast height
>
> (DBH) shall be removed without prior approval by DPDS.
>
> If TPAs are not shown on the development plan, the following condition of approval/binding element shall be attached to the plan:
>
> 6. The applicant shall identify and submit for approval by designated Division of Planning and Design Services (DPDS) staff, a plan showing the location of Tree Preservation Areas on site (exclusive of areas dedicated as public right-of-way) prior to beginning any construction procedure (i.e., clearing, grading, demolition). All construction shall be conducted in accordance
>
> with the approved Tree Preservation Plan. A partial plan may be submitted to delineate clearing necessary for preliminary site investigations. All Tree Preservation Plans must be prepared in accordance with the standards set forth by DPDS.
>
> WOODLAND PROTECTION AREA (WPA) Description:
>
> Woodland Protection Areas (WPAs) are treed portions of the site designated as part of the development approval process to be permanently protected either in a natural state or following selective removal of understory brush and/or trees as determined at the time of
>
> approval. WPAs shall be designated on approved development plans by location and
>
> described in associated notes, binding elements, or conditions of approval by general character (left natural, only trees below 2” caliper may be removed, etc.).
>
> WPAs may also be used to count toward Tree Canopy requirements for a development.
>
> No clearing, grading or other land disturbing activity shall take place in WPAs beyond pruning to improve the general health of the tree or to remove dead or declining trees that may pose a public health and safety threat. Additional activities within WPAs such as utility installation, fence construction, walks, or supplemental planting shall be determined at time of approval and/or described in notes, conditions or approval and/or binding elements on the plan.
>
> No structure may be closer than 15 feet to the Limit of Disturbance (tree protection fence) protecting a WPA. No vehicle use area (VUA) may be closer than 10 feet to the Limit of Disturbance (tree protection fence) protecting a WPA.
>
> WPAs will generally be protected by easement or other mechanism shown on the approved development plan or described in binding elements/conditions of approval for a development plan. Subdivision deeds of restriction are used as one tool to inform future property owners of clearing restrictions.
>
> Woodland Protection Area- dead/dying trees are to remain unless public, health, safety and welfare are compromised.
>
> Modification of Woodland Protection Areas shown on approved development plans may not be approved without notification of adjoining property owners and LD&T action.
>
> Requirements:
>
> All development plans showing WPAs shall submit and receive approval for a tree preservation plan in accordance with section 10.1.6 of the LDC prior to issuance of any site disturbance permit, and shall contain the following information and notes:
>
> *Information:*
>
> 1. Proposed site plan showing buildings, edges of pavement, property/lot lines, easements, existing topography, and other significant site features (LOJIC topographic information is acceptable).
