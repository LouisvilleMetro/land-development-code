The applicant will provide adequate information to allow the Commission to determine impacts of the proposal and compliance with the guidelines established in paragraph 7. below.
>
> If a Conditional Use Permit is required in conjunction with a review and approval under this section, the Conditional Use Permit review by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall not occur until the Planning Commission has concluded its review and approval
>
> under this section.
>
> 4. Review Authority
>
> a. The LD&T committee of Planning Commission may review development proposals and act on behalf of the Commission. The action taken by the committee can be appealed to the Planning Commission within thirty (30) days of such action. Failure to appeal the committee’s action in accordance with this section shall preclude further review and appeal.
>
> b. The following regulated activities may be reviewed for compliance with this regulation and approved by the director of the Planning Commission or the director's designee.
>
> i. Construction of a single family home on a lot created prior to the application of the Development Review Overlay.
>
> ii. Construction of one or more single family homes in a subdivision which the Planning Commission has approved in accordance with this regulation.

>
> of a non-residential structure by 100 percent or less.
>
> The action taken by the director may be appealed to the Planning Commission within thirty (30) days of such action. Failure to appeal the action of the director in accordance with this section shall preclude further review and appeal.
>
> 5. Submittal Requirements
>
> Submittal materials required by this section will be only as detailed as necessary to determine environmental impacts, without creating needless expense for the applicant. Persons contemplating development within the DRO area are encouraged to schedule a pre-application meeting with Planning Commission staff to determine if the project will require review under this regulation,
>
> and to identify materials that will have to be submitted. A proposed district development plan in accordance with the provisions of Plan Certain (Chapter 11 Part 6), may be needed depending upon the scope of the proposal.
>
> 6. Public Hearing Requirement:
>
> Persons seeking approval of a regulated activity other than those listed in paragraph 4.b., above shall supply the Planning Commission with the names and addresses of all persons designated by the property valuation administrator as owners of every parcel of property adjoining at any point the subject property and directly across the street from said property, and owners of every parcel of property which adjoins at any point the adjoining property or the property directly across the street from the subject property. The Planning Commission shall notify these adjoining property owners of the proposed development and shall solicit their comments concerning the need for a public hearing. For activities described in paragraph 4. b., the director of the Commission shall determine if notification of the above mentioned property owners and/or a hearing is warranted; the Planning Commission shall determine the need for a public hearing on other regulated activities. The Planning Commission shall send notice of the
>
> public hearing to said persons by first class mail not less than 7 nor more than 21 days prior to the hearing.
>
> 7. Guidelines for Approval:
>
> Design guidelines and performance standards which address the characteristics of each Development Review Overlay District shall be prepared. The Planning Commission shall use these design guidelines to determine impact of a proposed development on the quality of the environment in the Development Review District.
>
> The guidelines shall be enacted in ordinance by the legislative body, in conjunction with the amendment of the Zoning District Map to create each Development Review Overlay District.
>
> 8. Conditions of Approval
>
> The plan will be reviewed to determine if negative impacts on the environment can be overcome, mitigated to a substantial degree or proven not to exist. Upon incorporation of any necessary
>
> mitigative measures, approval of the development or activity will be given, contingent upon meeting other appropriate regulations including but not limited to Building Code requirements, Zoning District Regulations, Floodplain Regulations, Air Pollution Control and Health Code Requirements. The Planning Commission may disapprove a proposed district development plan if negative environmental impacts are not adequately mitigated. Revisions to an approved district development plan requested by the applicant will be reviewed by the Planning Commission. The Commission may require a public hearing, depending on the magnitude of change and the potential for environmental impacts.
>
> 9. Length of Plan Review Period
>
> It is the Planning Commission's goal to work with applicants, so that delay is minimized. Within 30 business days after submittal of all materials required under paragraph 3, above, the Planning Commission or its designee will take action on a proposed development. For those proposals which are taken to public hearing, the plan review period will be extended to 60 business days. Failure of the Planning Commission its designee to act on an application within these plan review periods shall authorize the
>
> applicant to proceed in accordance with the plan as filed, subject to other applicable regulatory approval and permit, unless the review period is extended by agreement between the Planning Commission and the applicant.
>
> 10. Actions Final
>
> Action by the Planning Commission on a proposed district development plan is final. Such action may be appealed in accordance with Kentucky Revised Statutes.
>
> 11. Enforcement:
>
> Immediately after approving a development plan under this article, the Planning Commission shall transmit a certified copy of the approved plan to the Building Department or Code Enforcement Office. The Building Department shall be authorized to issue permits only in accordance with the approved development plan
>
> under this section. In addition, violation of any feature of an approved development plan shall be treated in the same manner as a violation of the Zoning District Regulations.
>
> The following section contains the Floyds Fork DRO Guidelines which were adopted in February 1993.
>
> Intent: The intent of the Floyds Fork Design Guidelines is to insure that new development within the Floyds Fork Corridor is designed to aid in restoring and maintaining excellent quality for land and water resources of the Floyds Fork Corridor. The design guidelines are also intended to complement the natural landscape in order to obtain an aesthetically pleasing, rural atmosphere.
>
> Applicability: The following guidelines would apply to new development, including subdivisions, new construction, clearing and grading of land. Existing homes, farms and undeveloped property are not required to meet these standards. Before a building permit or subdivision is approved, the proposed plans would be reviewed for compliance with these standards. \[Note: Environmental constraints referenced within these guidelines are shown in the Core Graphics Section of the Comprehensive Plan, copies of which are available at the Planning Commission\].
>
> 1. Stream Corridors
>
> a. A buffer strip should be maintained a minimum of 100 feet wide on each side of Floyds Fork and a 50-foot wide strip on each side along tributaries shown on Map A. Steep slopes extending beyond the minimum buffer strip may necessitate a wider
>
> buffer. The buffer strip is to be measured from the ordinary high water mark. Riparian vegetation should be established, as necessary, and maintained along stream banks to stabilize the banks and protect water quality. Where a bank has been denuded of its vegetation through erosion, slope failure or similar occurrence, other vegetation such as KY-31 Fescue
>
> may be appropriate to quickly establish a vegetative cover. This should be considered however only as a temporary, interim solution. Selective removal of dying or diseased trees and shrubs within the buffer strip is permissible, provided that a live root system stays intact. Native plant material adequate for filtering surface drainage should be maintained within the buffer strip. \[Note: Small lots within the buffer strip will not be prevented from developing.\]
>
> b. Structures and impervious surfaces should be located at least
>
> 200 feet from each bank along Floyds Fork measured from the ordinary high water mark. In conjunction with the riparian vegetative buffer, this buffer protects the stream from adjacent development by filtering sediment, removing other pollution and reducing the force of runoff, In addition hazards from floods and erosion are reduced for development adjacent to the stream. \[Note: Small lots within the buffer strip will not be prevented
>
> from developing.\]
>
> c. Measures to avoid stream bank erosion are especially desirable; although limited grazing is beneficial to vegetation,
>
> excessive grazing of livestock near streams can be detrimental to vegetation and reduce the effectiveness of the buffer strip.
>
> d. In areas experiencing stream bank erosion, planting of native riparian vegetation is preferred. If this stabilization technique is determined to be inadequate by the agency responsible for drainage review, the preferred alternative is riprap that is installed in a manner that allows tree growth among the stones.
>
> e. Structures, impervious surfaces, septic systems and associated fill slopes should not be located within the floodplain. Stream crossings are an exception to this; crossings should be minimized and be aesthetically compatible with the natural values of the stream channel.
>
> f. Filling and excavation should not be permitted in the floodplain.
>
> Floodplains are recommended for agricultural and recreational use.
>
> g. Modification of streams shown on Map A including stream relocation and channelization is strongly discouraged. Watercourse modification as a convenience for site design purposes is not appropriate. Removal of fallen trees, tree limbs, brush and similar debris that accumulate naturally in creek beds and impede stream flow is acceptable.
>
> 2. Trees and Vegetation
>
> a. Existing wooded areas, in addition to the riparian buffer strip, should be retained wherever possible. Hillside vegetation in particular should be preserved.
>
> b. Wooded areas shown on the development plan as being retained should be preserved and maintained in healthy condition. As trees die or are removed, replacements should be provided.
>
> c. Grading and soil compaction by construction vehicles under the drip lines of trees and wooded areas intended to be retained should be minimized.
>
> d. Where grading within wooded areas is necessary, disturbed areas should be seeded to a shade tolerant plant species and mulched with straw.
>
> e. Proposed major subdivisions should indicate the limits of the site disturbance area for each lot being created. The site disturbance area should be shown in relation to environmental constraints: slopes over 20%, floodplains and wet soils.
>
> f. Proposed major subdivisions should indicate existing wooded areas to be retained and to be removed. The location of existing trees exceeding 18" in diameter at a point 54" above the ground that would be removed should be shown on the plan.
>
> g. Temporary protective fences should surround features to be preserved during the construction process. Features to be preserved shall be defined during the review process (e.g., trees, slopes, historical and archaeological sites).
>
> 3. Drainage and Water Quality
>
> a. On site wastewater disposal systems should be located to minimize potential water pollution. Lateral fields should be sited at least 150 feet from the ordinary high water mark of a stream shown on Map A.
>
> b. Areas identified as wetlands in studies approved by government agencies should be preserved in their natural state. Drainage, flooding patterns and any hydrologic system(s) needed to sustain the wetlands should not be altered. Existing vegetation and wildlife habitat should be preserved.
>
> c. To avoid soil loss, property damage, pollution and cleanup costs, an erosion and sediment control plan should be submitted for major subdivisions and other developments with potentially significant water quality impacts. Guidelines found in the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Practices Section of MSD's design manual currently in effect are to be used when preparing an erosion and sediment control plan. Additional information on this topic is available from Planning Commission staff.
>
> d. Runoff from impervious surfaces should be conveyed in a manner that minimizes erosion. Natural stormwater channels are preferred over manmade materials such as conveyances constructed of concrete.
>
> e. Adequate provision should be made to prevent any storm or surface water from damaging the cut face of any excavation or the sloping face of any fill. When necessary for protection of critical areas, diversion ditches or terraces should be provided.
>
> f. Developers of major subdivisions should plant, water and maintain vegetative cover on graded slopes on each unsold property until all properties have been sold.
>
> 4. Hillsides
>
> a. Design subdivisions and locate structures to preserve the natural character of the land to the greatest extent possible.
>
> b. Areas with slopes of 20% or greater generally should not be disturbed.
>
> c. Major subdivisions with developable lots or roadways situated on slopes of 33% or greater should be permitted only if a report prepared by a qualified geotechnical or soils engineer documents that the proposed design will not result in hazardous conditions and certifies work during construction.
>
> d. Minimize cuts and fills. Necessary cuts, fills and ether earth modifications should be replanted with appropriate vegetation. Minimize the practice of terracing hillsides in order to provide additional building sites. Structural containment of slopes should be minimized; retaining walls exceeding six feet in height should be avoided.
>
> 5. Clustering of Residential Use
>
> a. Site planning should create cluster patterns of new development whenever possible: building sites and land disturbance activity should be concentrated in portions of the site better suited for development, to minimize disruption of environmentally sensitive areas and to retain the corridor's rural character. Clustering allows significant portions of the site to remain undeveloped, while achieving an amount of
>
> development comparable to traditional site plans and reducing development costs.
>
> b. Preservation of agricultural use, including pastures and sustained-yield wood lots, is encouraged.
>
> \[Note: Cluster developments including lots less than 5 acres in size, with on-lot wastewater disposal, may be approved if designed in accordance with the DRO guidelines.\]
>
> 6. Historic Elements
>
> a. Where possible, preserve and retain historic elements and distinctive site features such as old buildings, cemeteries, archaeological sites, fence rows, walls and other significant signs of past land use, and as otherwise identified by the agency responsible for historic preservation.
>
> 7. Vistas and Appearance
>
> **Residential Development**
>
> a. New construction along designated scenic corridors (Map A) should preserve the area's rural appearance. In existing wooded areas a buffer area 60 feet in width and densely vegetated should be maintained, to create an effective visual barrier. Outside the wooded areas (agricultural or open lands), new development should provide a substantial setback from the roadway (400 feet minimum) with plantings to partially screen buildings (1 tree per 25 feet of building facade visible from the road). An alternative to the substantial setback is to create a 60- foot buffer thickly planted with fast growing native trees and shrubs. Residential developments having two or more dwellings per acre should provide the 60-foot buffer.
>
> b. Placement of new homes within an existing wooded area, or along far edges of open fields adjacent to woodland; is encouraged (to reduce impact upon agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from wind and to enable new
>
> construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features).
>
> c. Creation of new driveways from designated scenic corridors should be minimized; common driveways and shared access points are encouraged. Where appropriate for the site's topography and traffic volumes gravel rather than paved drives are encouraged.
>
> d. Signature entrances located along designated scenic corridors should not exceed six feet in height or 50 feet in total length (25 feet each side).
>
> **Non-Residential Development**
>
> e. New development should be setback a minimum of 50 feet from the right-of-way line of designated scenic corridors (Map A).
>
> This area is reserved to accommodate landscaping consistent with the "rural character" of the Floyds Fork corridor. When used in this context, development includes all buildings, signs,
>
> parking lots; service drives and access roads that parallel designated scenic corridors.
>
> f. Landscaping in the 50 foot green space (1a. above) along designated scenic corridors should include earth berming (average height of three feet) and shrub masses to screen parking areas. Large deciduous trees, a minimum of one tree for every 50 feet of roadway frontage, should be planted in the green space. Existing trees should be retained whenever possible, both in the buffer area and within the area to be developed. Trees should be planted at least ten feet from the right-of-way.
>
> g. Parking lots should be provided only at the side or rear of the buildings to reduce visual impact of the use while providing an appropriate level of visibility.
>
> h. Buildings, parking lots, and other impervious surfaces should cover no more than 75 percent of each site. The remainder of the site should be planted and maintained with live vegetative cover so as to reduce visual impacts as well as drainage and run off problems.
>
> i. Newly installed utility services should be underground and service structures should be screened as required by Chapter
>
> 10 of the Development Code.
>
> j. Attached and monument type signs are preferred (see glossary for definition); pole signs should be avoided.
>
> k. Permanent freestanding signs for property or business identification should not exceed six feet in height or sixty square feet in area. Attached signs are governed by size standards found in the Zoning District Regulations.
>
> l. Billboards, off-premise advertising signs of any kind, banners, balloons, and pennants should not be visible from a scenic corridor.
>
> **All Development**
>
> m. Buildings should be planned and designed and vegetation should be managed to preserve and enhance scenic vistas along roadways shown on Map A.
>
> n. The visual impact of new structures proposed for prominent hillsides visible from public facilities, scenic corridors and the stream itself should be minimized. Trees should be retained or planted to screen them or to create a filtered view of these structures (one tree per 25 feet of building facade length).
>
> o. When it is necessary to use retaining walls, their height should be minimized. A series of smaller retaining walls is preferable to one large wall, provided that the series of walls can be built without excessive removal of vegetation during construction. Retaining walls faced with brick or stone are preferable.
>
> p. Hedges and fence rows (trees and shrubs growing along a fence) are the preferred means of property enclosure provided they do not obstruct scenic vistas. If chain link fencing is to be used, it should blend with its setting (painted or vinyl coated with dark colors such as black, green or brown). Unscreened galvanized chain link fencing is appropriate only for areas not visible from roads shown on Map A.
>
> q. Parking areas, outbuildings, satellite dishes, and other less attractive aspects of a development should be screened from view. Where total screening is impractical, partial measures that lessen the full visual impact of development are recommended.

The Guidelines are intended to promote compatibility of new development with existing land use and design features, to enhance the District's visual quality, to preserve the District's commercial character with a pedestrian friendly environment and to strengthen the economic vitality of the District by encouraging new investment and further business and commercial development, in appropriate locations within the District.
>
> 3. The application of Guidelines is intended to provide public review in the public interest of the design elements of a proposed development within the District and of the community impact of a proposed demolition of a Contributing Historical Structure within the District. Accordingly, public participation shall be encouraged in the review process.
>
> 4. The Guidelines are not intended to discourage commercial development but to encourage such development which is innovative and aesthetically pleasing in design. A development proposal that does not conform to one or more specific guidelines may be approved if it is determined that the proposal is in conformance with the intent of the guidelines considered as a whole.
>
> 5. It shall be a condition precedent to obtaining any permit for any development activity within the District that the person has obtained a Permit pursuant to this Ordinance. Permits shall be issued only where it is determined, pursuant to the procedures established by this Ordinance, that the proposed development activity is in compliance with the Guidelines.
>
> B. Design Review Guidelines
>
> 1. Location, Height and Orientation

>
> ii. Sight lines of facade heights as seen from the adjacent sidewalk should be generally consistent with those of adjacent buildings.
>
> iii. Structures greater than three stories high may be permissible if taller portions are set back from the street frontage so that overall sight lines are compatible and if the increased height is not intrusive for adjacent residential areas.
>
> 2. Historic Preservation
>
> a. Changes to the exterior of Contributing Historic Structures and other Structures within the corridor which are more than 50 years old and which have not been significantly altered shall be reviewed in accordance with the standards established for Contributing Historic Structures by the United States Secretary of the Interior, but the Director, in his discretion, may relax
>
> these standards in the interest of accomplishing the intentions of these Guidelines.
>
> b. The design of new or substantially remodeled Structures which are adjacent to Contributing Historic Structures should be compatible with them and should incorporate design elements of such Structures, where appropriate.
>
> c. No application to demolish any Contributing Historical Structure or Structure more than 50 years old shall be approved by the Director unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction
>
> of the Director:
>
> i. That the rehabilitation of a Structure or construction of a new Structure will have a greater positive impact upon the District's economic vitality and appearance than the preservation of the Structure proposed to be demolished and the rehabilitation of the Structure or the construction of the new Structure would not be possible or economically

>
> ii. Other exterior materials are appropriate if compatible with existing exterior materials traditionally used within the area.
>
> b. Fencing
>
> i. Fencing and screening walls should be constructed of materials compatible with the principal Structure.
>
> ii. Chain link fencing should not be visible from the Corridor.
>
> 4. Site Development, Landscaping and Open Spaces
>
> a. i. Development proposals should include maintainable, attractive year-round landscaping, street trees or planter boxes along the street frontage of any development site to reinforce the building pattern.
>
> ii. Development proposals should provide screening to reduce visual impacts on adjacent residential neighborhoods.
>
> b. Development Plans, if feasible, should minimize the adverse visual impact of utility lines on the Corridor. Underground lines or service from the alley, where feasible, is encouraged.
>

>
> the visual quality of the blockface in which the development is located.
>
> b. i. Attached signs are preferred. Attached signage composed of individual letters or symbols is also preferred.
>
> ii. Projecting signs and free-standing monument signs with a base affixed to the ground which measures at least two- thirds the horizontal length of the sign and has a maximum height of six feet (6'0") are acceptable when consistent with the pattern of business signs in the blockface in which the development is located.
>
> iii. A free-standing sign mounted on its own support system typically a pole or post is inappropriate for a development with less than 120 feet of frontage on the corridor except where the denial of a free-standing sign would effectively prevent the business from adequately identifying itself. Under these circumstances a free-standing monument sign is preferred.
>
> c. i. Signs should be designed for good graphic communication. ii. Signs should be integrated with the design of the Structure
>
> or development with which they are associated and with the
>
> pattern of business signs in the blockface in which the development is located.
>
> d. i. Signs should not be higher than 20 feet nor located above the cornice line of the Structure.

> A. General Regulations
>
> 1. Upon the effective date of this Ordinance, within the overlay districts, no person shall commence any development activity as defined in § 158.07 without obtaining a permit issued, without cost, pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 158.08 certifying compliance with the applicable overlay district development review guidelines.
>
> 2. The Development Review Guidelines, attached hereto as Exhibit D, as amended on the effective date of this Ordinance and incorporated herein by reference, are enacted. The Development Review Guidelines are not intended to discourage development or to dictate architectural design or style, but to encourage such development that contributes to the overall urban design quality of the downtown and of each district. These Development Review Guidelines and the distinctive characteristics for each overlay district shall be the basis for evaluating applications for development proposals as applicable within each district as follows:

|              | a.  | All Principles, as defined in Section 158.03, which are part of the Development Review Guidelines for a particular Overlay District, must be satisfied before an overlay district permit may be issued.                                                                                                                                                                |        |
|--------------|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|              | b.  | In order to demonstrate conformance with a particular Principle for an Overlay District and compliance with the Development Review Guidelines, a development application need not satisfy all District guidelines, as defined in Section 158.03, which                                                                                                                 
                      >

> d. Upon making a determination that a development application concerns a site which is located in sufficient proximity to one or more other Overlay Districts and that it shares some of the characteristics of such nearby Overlay District or Districts, the Urban Design administrator or the Downtown Development Review Overlay District Committee, as authorized respectively under Section 158.08(E) and Section 158.08(F), may consider the District Guidelines applicable appropriate, in determining conformance with that same Principle in the Overlay District in which the proposed development is located. However, a development application shall not be required to satisfy all of the District Guidelines for that same Principle in the other Overlay Districts in order to demonstrate compliance with the Principle.
>
> e. If a development application involves a phased project, the Urban Design Administrator or the Committee, as authorized respectively under Section 158.08(E) and Section 158.08(F), may, as a condition of approval of an overlay district permit for the first phase or phases, require landscaping, fencing, lighting and such other interim treatments as the Administrator or the Committee may determine appropriate for the undeveloped portion of the phased project.
>
> 3. It shall be a condition precedent to obtaining any permit for any development activity within an overlay district that the person has obtained an overlay district permit pursuant to this Section. Permits shall be issued only where it is determined, pursuant to the procedures established by this chapter, that the proposed development activity is in compliance with the Development Review Guidelines for the overlay district. In order to ensure that this Ordinance continues to further the goals and objectives of the Louisville Downtown Development Plan, the Committee shall review the Guidelines and recommend to the Board any amendments necessary.
>
> 4. The Downtown Review Overlay shall be comprised of the
>
> following four sections whose boundaries are described in the City of Louisville Code of Ordinances Title XV, Chapter 158, Exhibit A:
>
> a. Core-Broadway Overlay District
>
> b. East-West Downtown Overlay District c. Main-Market Overlay District
>
> d. Waterfront View Overlay District
>
> B. Core-Broadway Overlay District
>
> 1. All new construction or improvements should be built to property lines.
>
> 2. Whenever nearby buildings are primarily built to the sidewalk, the shapes and forms of new construction or improvements should create a strong, well-defined base at pedestrian level that fits well into its context. As a general minimum, this base should be two to three stories.
>
> 3. To allow adequate light and air, tall building (over 14 stories)
>
> should generally:
>
> a. Keep 100 feet between other tall building within the same block.
>
> b. Make sure the upper stories of tall buildings are progressively narrower.
>
> 4. The shapes and forms of a building and its orientation to the street, to people and to nearby buildings should:
>
> a. Enhance existing views and vistas--or potential ones. b. Be sensitive to any impact on the pedestrian, including
>
> overexposure to the sun, too much wind, or not enough light or
>
> air.
>
> c. Relate strongly to nearby buildings, particularly at the edges of the district where stepbacks or changes in building height and volume are important.
>
> 5. Rooftops should avoid looking cluttered from any vantage point.
>
> All mechanical or utility equipment should be well-integrated into the overall design.
>
> 6. The exterior of any construction, improvements or alterations should be designed and detailed so that it fits well into its architectural surroundings. Exteriors should:
>
> a. Be compatible with the general character of nearby buildings. b. Reinforce the character of any buildings having historic or
>
> architectural significance according to the Downtown
>
> Development Plan.
>
> c. Follow the latest edition of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as a guide whenever historic or architecturally significant structures are involved; in short, don't alter significant features.
>
> 7. Blank, fortress-like walls at the street level are discouraged.
>
> Buildings in the Core-Broadway District should:
>
> a. Strive to maintain the vertical street-level patterns of architectural details common throughout the district. Columns,
>
> Downtown Overlay District
>
> doorways, entrances, storefronts and other vertical elements should be approximately every 20 to 40 feet at pedestrian level.
>
> b. Use glass to encourage people activity and make buildings
>
> look and feel more inviting to the pedestrian. As a general rule,
>
> 50 percent of the wall surface next to the pedestrian should be clear.
>
> c. Use design details to emphasize the building's base, so that there's a strong horizontal feeling to which people at sidewalk level can easily relate.
>
> 8. Lighting--interior and exterior--is important in making buildings and the downtown in general look and feel more inviting 24 hours a day. Lighting should:
>
> a. Be integrated into the exterior design.
>
> b. Help create a greater sense of activity, security and interest to the pedestrian.
>
> 9. Any parking garage visible from the street should be integrated
>
> into its surroundings and provide an active and inviting street-level use and appearance. The garage should:
>
> a. Follow all guidelines for Building Design.
>
> b. Avoid ramped floors that are clearly visible from the street.
>
> c. Make sure the predominant vertical and horizontal architectural forms and patterns within the districts are followed.
>
> d. Be sensitive to conflicts between cars and pedestrians.
>
> e. Have openings and entrances that are in scale with people.
>
> f. Provide adequate direction and information signs for motorists.
>
> 10. Surface parking lots should ideally not create gaps along the street and sidewalk. Any surface lot in the district should:
>
> a. Use landscaping, trees, colonnades or other construction to maintain the line formed by buildings along the sidewalk.
>
> b. Make sure there is adequate perimeter landscaping that is high enough to screen but low enough to let people feel safe.
>

> The nine (9) urban design principles defined below were developed from the recommendations of the Louisville Downtown Development Plan adopted by the Board of Aldermen in August 1990. These nine principles apply to each of the four (4) development review overlay districts identified within the downtown area. For each of the four overlay districts, there are district guidelines that relate to each of the nine principles.

> **Principle 5**
>
> Off-Street Parking

Different downtown districts have taken on distinct identities over time that need to be respected. Buildings in some areas are set back from the sidewalk, creating an open feeling. Others give people a feeling of density and activity, with buildings built right up to the sidewalk.

Buildings should allow adequate light and air to get to the street level. Vistas and views from publicly owned areas are also important. Buildings shouldn't create canyons along sidewalks and streets.

A certain amount of architectural diversity is expected in any downtown. However, buildings should also be "good neighbors" by relating well to the common patterns of windows, entrances, cornice lines and column spacings around them and reinforcing the overall character of their immediate surroundings.

People should have strong visual connections to buildings. That's because human-scaled details on buildings help create a vital, friendly place for pedestrians. A strong building-to-pedestrian relationship helps make downtown feel more inviting and active 24 hours a day.

Parking garages and surface parking lots should have the same qualities and characteristics as any other downtown development. In other words, parking developments should relate strongly to nearby buildings and should be designed to promote comfort and safety for pedestrians on the street and the sidewalk.

> **Principle 6**
>
> Open Space

> **Principle 7**
>
> Street and Sidewalk Character - Sidewalk and street paving, lighting, furniture, banners, fences, walls and landscaping
>
> **Principle 8**
>
> **Principle 9**
>
> Art and Amenities

New open space should be located and designed to relate strongly to pedestrians and to buildings nearby. New or improved open space should make the downtown less barren and more active, livable and pleasant feeling.

Downtown streets and sidewalks should be safe and attractive for both cars and pedestrians. Getting from one place to another should be a pleasant, comfortable and rewarding downtown experience.

Signs should provide clear information without overwhelming the reader. Signs should complement other signs and blend with buildings and the rest of their surroundings.

Public art and other amenities are part of our community's strong cultural heritage. They enrich and enliven people's experience of the downtown. Public art also creates a sense of pride, enhances property values and should be encouraged.

> ***WATERFRONT REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT***
>
> **162.40 CREATION AND BOUNDARIES.**
>
> (A) (1) Pursuant to KRS 82.660 - 82.670, the W aterfront Review Overlay District (the "District") is created in order to provide additional regulations for design standards and development for the District.
>
> (2) The boundaries of the Dis trict shall be as set forth on Exhibit A, attached to Ordinance No. 66-2004 and incorporated herein by reference.
>
> (3) The distinctive characteristics of the District are described in Exhibit B, attached to Ordinance No.
>
> 66-2004 and incorporated herein by reference.
>
> (B) Description of boundaries. The Waterfront Review Overlay (WRO) District, for the purpose of d esign reviews by the Waterfront Development C orporation, shall be considered to consist of three s ub-areas with boundaries, which are incorporated by reference thereto and made a part of this subchapter.
>
> (1) Area A-l: Downtown (CBD) waterfront area. Consistent with the W-l and C-3 z oning, the intent is to achieve a high degree of public u se with parks, hotels, public assembly areas, high density residential areas, and river theme retail commercial uses. The character envisioned is an u rban district with hard-edged landscape and streetscape treatment, especially pedestrian oriented f or day and night use with continuous public access to t he water's edge.
>
> (2) Area A-2: This area provides the potential to expand the downtown waterfront oriented b usinesses and public uses. Protection of the established character of historic structures and t he extension of the established Main Street scale are important. Transition and connection from the CBD t o the river for the public, and especially pedestrian movement, are key concepts. Pedestrian and vehicular linkages north and south across River Road are important concerns.
>
> (3) Area B: This area contains Eva Bandman Park which is a community active and passive recreation area and should serve as a transition b uffer from the urbanizing waterfront of Areas A-l and B to the indus trial waterfront in C-l. Area B is suited for a mix of public and private uses as p ermitted with W-2 zoning. Extension of the public assembly and gathering facilities and river's edge a ccessibility easterly from Area A-l is encouraged. A transition from the urban waterfront of A-l to a mix o f developed and natural landscape at the water' s edge i s expected. Residential use is encouraged with densities variable from high to medium, taking advantage of adjacency to the river and public park land and proximity to the CBD.
>
> (4) Area C-l: The balance of C-l is primarily zoned W-3 with the intent of providing r iver-oriented industry a location for operation. Public access to the river's edge is preferred, but it is understood that safety, security or other business needs may make river edge access impractical. The k ey design issues for the area include the visual relationships of proposed development (height and mass) to River Road, to area C-2 south of River Road, and to vistas from 1-64, 1-71 and the river. C irculation and access impacts on the proposed River Road Parkway are also import ant issues. Industrial development proposed within the W-3 area, of the W RO district, shall receive a decreased level of review. Specifically, design criteria relating to the district's image will only apply to the areas visible from River Road and to a lesser degree from the Ohio R iver. Once it is determined
>
> July 2004 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE 3C-1
>
> that, by virtue of its "interior" location, a development proposal does not impact the district's image, notice will be given the applicant to proceed.
>
> (5) Area C-2: This area is south of River Road and is expected to have both public and private open space and recreation and uses on the eastern end, and have the potential for private and public uses on t he western side similar to the expectation for Area B. The design issues focus on the 1-64, 1-71 and River R oad corridors, where it is desirable for these to continue to serve as scenic, landscaped approaches to Louisv ille' s CBD from the east. Development will be reviewed with the idea that intensity will diminish
>
> from the medium density dominant in Area B to the pastoral, open-space character present at the eastern edge of the
>
> Review District. (Lou. Metro Ord. No. 66-2004, approved 6-3-2004)

>
> **162.42 REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITY AND PLANS.**
>
> (A) The Waterfront Development Corporation shall review any developmental activity within the waterfront review overlay district as provided in § § 162.40 through 162.48. The review by the Corporation is limited to the polic ies and standards established in §§ 162.40 through 162.48 and shall not i nclude any consideration of whether the use is appropriate under the zoning regulations.
>
> (B) The Board shall review all plans for conformity with the design standards established in § 153.77, and, in addition, shall consider whether the developmental ac tivity is compatible with the overall scheme of development for the waterfront area. In making that determination, the Board shall be guided
>
> by the following policy statements of basic goals and concepts for the Waterfront Review District:
>
> (1) Unified public spaces. The waterfront and adjacent lands in the district should be planned in a coordinated manner, with connected open-space systems, pedestrian ways, and public activity areas. Landscape concepts and details of materials and construction shall be related to convey a sense of harmony and unity.
>
> (2) Continuity and coordinated private d evelopment. Design theme and aesthetic concept should both exhibit a relationship to the waterfront, and be coordinated with adjacent development. As appropriate, circulation systems should have continuity between parcels.
>
> (3) Public accessibility to river's edge. The Ohio River water's edge should be accessible to the public for view and use t hroughout the W-l and W-2 areas, and is preferred, where practicable, in the C-l p ortion of the W-3 area.
>
> (4) River's edge treatment. The waterfront is viewed as the city's front door and the face of the community. The quality of its appearance is important. The views from the river, 1-71, 1-64 and ot her vantage points are to be considered in design.
>
> (5) River Road Parkway. River Road serves as a main entrance to the city and as an access r oad to the waterfront. This resource should be developed as a unified visual experience, in the tradition of the city's existing parkway system.
>
> (6) Downtown connection. The Central Business District (CBD) of the city should be tied directly to the waterfront through pedestrian and vehicular connections.
>
> (7) River's edge concept. From the wharf and Belveder e area of the eastern limit of the WRO a rea the character of the river's edge will change from an urban "hard edged" setting to a natural and n aturalized landscape appearance.
>
> (8) River Road Parkway concept. The parkway is viewed as a man-made linear open space
>
> serving as a major entry to the city. From downtown to Zorn Avenue the character is expected to range from an urban tree-lined and lighted boulevard scene, through a transitional multi-use developed setting, to a naturalized open- space appearance. (Lou. Metro Ord. No. 66-2004, approved 6-3-2004)
>
> **162.43 PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES.**
>
> (A) On and after the effective date of this subchapter no person shaE make any alteration to a s tructure or building or undertake new construction as d efined in § 162.41 within the District without o btaining a permit issued, without cost, pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 162.46 certifying compliance with the applicable design standards for the district as set forth in § 162.48.
>
> (B) The purpose of the district is to control development within the district in order to:
>
> (1) Protect waterfront property as a valuable asset to the community in terms of quality of life and economic development;
>
> (2) Protect

public investment in the

waterfront area;

>
> **162.48 DESIGN GUIDELINES.**
>
> (A) The Waterfront Development Corporation, in interpreting the design standards established by this subchapter shall consider the following design principles:
>
> (1) Functional requirements. A design shall meet the basic criteria for satisfying its program. Relationships between parking and buildings, for e xample, shall meet accepted standards of des ign for engineering and accessibility.
>
> (2) Systems relationships and continuity. T he project shall be into other projects and planned systems, such as pedestrian ways, landscaping patterns, lighting concepts, and traffic movements.
>
> (3) Visual relationships and continuity. The way one sees the project in relation to its context is important. Such considerations as the view from the road, from the river, or from other vantage points such as from above, in vista or panorama, at day or night, or in different seasons may be of consequence.
>
> (4) Aesthetic and symbolic meaning. The style and form should relate a project to the historic set ting or to the unique qualities of its city waterfront location.
>
> (5) Architectural and landscape c omposition. Scale, form, and materials are the basic e lements of building and site design. The relationships between buildings and the relationship between projects and their settings are significant. A project should be expressive of contemporary thinking in design. Questions of style should be focused on relationships of form and material rather than replication of historic architectural periods.
>
> (6) Pedestrian activity and scale. The quality of experience for the individual or for groups in varying activities is of great importance. Land use, architectural design, landscape design and public art combine at the human scale to contribute to quality places for people.
>
> (B) The following general standards shall apply in the WRO District. (1) Views:
>
> (a) Maintaining and improving views of the river is desired. Structures should be designed to allow views of the river from adjacent streets; massing and placement of buildings should maximize a cone of vision that includes a view of the riverfront and does not obscure the view from other developments.
>
> (b) Treatment of river edges should be visually appealing from the river vantage point as well as from the
>
> shore.
>
> (2) Landscape and grading:
>
> (a) Continuity of landscape concept and harmony between development parcels is expected.
>
> (b) Design concept, materials selection, and detailing of public spaces should have a harmony and unity expressive of an overall scheme. I n the absence of a detailed "master" site plan, the Corporation shall look for overall continuity and theme among projects.
>
> (c) The filling of land for development p urposes shall consider the scenic quality of the parkway and the river's edge. Fill operations are to b e set-back from the landscape buffer area, graded w ith side slopes, and varied in contour as needed to present a "naturalized contour." Continuity between adjacent parcels is important.
>
> (d) Maintaining the natural character and contours of grade of the existing river bank, within the designated setback, is encouraged, especially in Areas B and C-l.
>
> (e) Surface areas used for parking should be l andscaped or fenced to partially screen s uch areas from view from access streets, freeways, adjacent properties, and from the waterfront. Parking structures should include perimeter landscaping. Berms (in combination with plantings or low walls) screening parking are appropriate and desired, with variations in contours achieving either a natural or cultivated appearance as best relates to the land use it adjoins.
>
> (f) When the top level of parking structures is used for parking and is readily seen from public streets or residential or hotel structures, rooftop landscape treatment shall be reviewed for its design quality
>
> (g) In highly visible surface parking lots, use of alternative surfaces such as paving blocks or "grass- crete" is encouraged.
>
> (h) Where landscaping is selected for screening purposes, the seasonal density and buffering capabilities of selected plan material shall be reviewed. Seasonal variety of color and form should be an important consideration in the choice of materials for aesthetic intent.
>
> (3) Circulation (pedestrian and vehicular):
>
> (a) Pedestrian systems and street c rossings that encourage trips on foot, particularly from the downtown to the waterfront area, should be provided.
>
> (b) The quality of the sidewalk environment should be enhanced by means of appropriate landscaping, lighting, graphi cs, street furniture, and design; concrete paving in compliance w ith the CBD sidewalk standards, or finish material such as brick or stone pavers, should be provided.
>
> (c) Internal pedestrian circulation s ystems should coordinate with the parkway plans and r iver's edge plans and standards for walks, bikeways, jogging trails, and other movement systems or patterns.
>
> (d) Parking lots, storage areas and s imilar uses should be located away from the river's edge and on unobtrusive sites. In areas characterized by buildings along the street line, parking lots should be located behind or on the side of buildings, whenever possible.
>
> encouraged.

(e) Designated public pedestrian access w ays between River Road and the river's edge should be

> (f) The public river walkway should be continued along the river's edge in Areas A-l and B. Its design should be sensitive to the character of the surrounding waterfront development.
>
> (g) The pedestrian systems (walks, jogging trails) and bicycle paths should be developed along the parkway and in accordance with plans for River Road.
>
> (h) Public transit service, through access to TARC routes, should be provided and should include shelters and waiting areas for appropriate group sizes, in public and private developments.
>
> (4) Building design, materials, and colors:
>
> (a) The use of unfinished common c oncrete block, cinder block, or corrugated panel as t he main facing material for exterior walls is discouraged.
>
> (b) Construction should be of quality finish materials such as brick, stone masonry, and architectural concrete and should be in harmony with the surrounding character of the waterfront development.
>
> (c) Simulated materials such as vinyl and aluminum siding should be avoided.
>
> (d) Predominant exterior colors should be of natur al materials or those that are complimentary and harmonious to the character of the surrounding waterfront development.
>
> (e) Bright colors should not dominate but may be permitted as a compatible accent.
>
> (f) Large areas of blank walls (including parking garage f rontage) should be avoided. Pedestrian and active-use areas at street l evel are encouraged. Special treatment with screening, landscaping, and the like, is desired where such conditions are unavoidable.
>
> (g) When the first or st reet level of a s tructure is used for park ing, storage, or is a vac ant area, appropriate treatment of masonry, finish ma terial, screening, or landscaping should be p rovided to minimize unsightliness.
>
> (h) Mechanical equipment or utility equipment located on the exterior of a building should
>
> be appropriately screened from public view or designed as an integral part of the overall exterior appearances the building facade.

(5) Preservation of historic structures and

> (a) Projects which provide for adaptive r euse of historic buildings and sites eligible for the National
>
> Register of Historic Places shall be favorably reviewed.
>
> (b) All buildings are recognized as p roducts of their own time. Contemporary design is encouraged except where such design would clearly detract from the design compatibility within a group of h istorically significant structures. Alterations, additions, and new developments should be s ympathetic to and harmonious with the historic context, and not seek to mimic an earlier style.
>
> (c) The distinguishing original qualities o f a property should not be diminished through alteration or removal of distinctive architectural features. When replacing original material, new material should closely match the original in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
>
> (d) If cobblestones are located within the proposed development, they are to be c ollected and either reincorporated into the project's design or given to the city. Cobblestones are considered h istorical artifacts and are the property of the city.
>
> (6) Lighting:
>
> (a) Lighting fixtures in publicly accessible areas should be decorative and similar to or compatible with the Victorian fixtures installed downtown. In Areas A-l and B, light color should be the same as that used at the wharf.
>
> (b) Exterior lighting should enhance the site and building design. (c) Specialized lighting is permitted to accent landscape features.
>
> (d) Lighting should be restrained to p revent excessive brightness and undue glare on a djacent properties and the river.
>
> (e) Lighting levels and color shall be d esigned in consideration of the overall effect on p atterns, repetition, focal points, and rhythm within the panorama of the waterfront.
>
> (7) Utilities:
>
> (a) All utility services (telephone, electrical, cable, and the like) shall be installed underground.
>
> (b) Utility components required to be above ground (transformers, meters, and the like) s hall either be screened by landscaping or decorative wall or located away from public view.
>
> (8) Retaining walls, fencing and railing:
>
> (a) Retaining walls should be faced with masonry or other decorative screening or landscaping to minimize the blank appearance of such walls.
>
> development.

(b) Fence and rail design should be c ompatible with the surrounding character of the w aterfront

> (c) Proposed fencing should not limit a ctual or visual access to the waterfront, except where necessary for safety or security. Fencing material visible from publicly accessible areas should compliment surrounding architectural materials; chain link fencing is inappropriate in these areas.
>
> (d) When determined that screening is n ecessary, fencing, if used as screening, shall be solid, and shall include vegetation. Landscaping used for screening shall form a complete year-round opaque screen.
>
> (9) Flood plain:
>
> (a) A flood control system shall be i ntegrated within the development's design. Physical and visual barriers to the waterfront are discouraged.
>
> (b) The design of lower levels, exposed to flood elevations, shall be integrated with the structure so it will not be unsightly or unrelated to either the habitable portion of the building or the surrounding landscape.
>
> (10) Signage:
>
> (a) Signs should be des igned to enhance the area's visual appeal and ability to attract the public. The size, height, number and design of s igns shall be reviewed for their ability to achieve t hese goals as well as their impact on traffic safety.
>
> (b) In general, attached signs should b e designed to fit within the architectural space intended for signage and not cover architectural features.
>
> (c) Signs seen in relation to other signs should be des igned to be c ompatible in loc ation, shape, style, graphics, size, material, illumination, and color. Uniformity should be maintained in certain c haracteristics while other characteristics should be varied to permit individual expression and identification.
>
> (d) Outdoor advertising signs ( billboards), pennants, streamers and temporary signs a re not appropriate in the Waterfront area except for special events, building openings, and the like which shall be subject to expedited review under § 162.45(B)(1).
>
> (C) The following standards shall apply only within the WRO sub-areas: (1) Standards specific to Areas a-1 and A-2:
>
> (a) Strong access connections between Main Street and the waterfront should be maintained.
>
> (b) The urban grid of streets and sidewalks s hould be extended into the areas in a logical and appropriate manner to achieve a physical and perceptual relationship between the CBD and the waterfront.
>
> context.

(c) Individual buildings and structures should be situated in relation to the existing urban grid and historic

> (2) Standards specific to Area B: Dock construction should be developed to meet recreational needs, with floating docks using support masts d esigned as an integral part of the overall appearance. C overed slips should not be permitted for the typical boat slips.
