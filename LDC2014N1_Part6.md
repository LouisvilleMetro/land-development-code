> Form district regulations supplement and extend use and density regulations associated with individual zoning districts. Zoning district regulations address the permitted and conditional uses for any given site in a specific zoning district, as well as the permitted density or intensity of development. Form district regulations govern the design of permitted uses and land activities to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses and activities, adequate transportation access, and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare.

>
> No building, structure, or land shall be subdivided, erected, constructed, located or moved except in conformity with the regulations contained in this Chapter, and any other applicable regulations in this Code. Prior to the issuance of any building or site construction permit, a determination of conformance with these regulations shall be made by the appropriate Planning or Building Official.
>
> The form district regulations shall apply only to new construction and development, including expansions. Structures in existence prior to the effective date of this Chapter 5 shall not be required to meet the standards created herein.
>
> No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered to exceed the height limit established for the form district in which the building is located. No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in conformity with the area require- ments of the district in which the building is located. Lots created after the effective date of this Land Development Code shall meet the minimum area requirements of the applicable form district.
>
> Where there is doubt concerning the interpretation of the provisions of this Chapter, the decision of the Planning Director shall prevail, subject to appeal as provided for in Chapter 11 Part 7.
>
> **5.1.3 Establishment of Form Districts**
>
> In order to carry out the purposes and pr ovisions of this Code, the following form districts are hereby established:
>
> A. Downtown Form District
>
> B. Neighborhood Form District
>
> C. Traditional Neighborhood Form District
>
> D. Village Form District
>
> E. Town Center Form District
>
> F. Traditional Marketplace Corridor Form District G. Suburban Marketplace Corridor Form District H. Traditional Workplace Form District
>
> I. Suburban Workplace Form District
>
> J. Regional Center Form District
>
> K. Campus Form District
>
> **5.1.4 Form District Map**
>
> The Planning Unit shall be divided into form districts, as shown on the Official Zoning and Form District Map. The Official Zoning and Form District Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, shall be a part of this Code and is incorporated into this Code by this reference. The Map shall be kept on file in the offices of the Division of Planning and Design Services and shall be the official record of the form district designation of all sites and areas within the planning unit.
>
> **5.1.5 Interpretation of Form District Boundaries**
>
> In cases of uncertainty as to the location of a form district boundary on the Official Zoning and Form District Map, the rules for interpretation located at Section 2.1.2 shall apply. The form district classification of property at the water’s edge of the Ohio River’s normal pool elevation shall be deemed to extend from the water’s edge to the County (Indiana) boundary, unless otherwise indicated on the Official Zoning and Form District Map.
>
> **5.1.6 Map Amendment Process**
>
> The process and requirements for amendment of a form district boundary or form district designation are located in Chapter 11 Part 4.
>
> **5.1.7 General Requirements1**
>
> The following standards are applicable to development proposals, within all form districts.
>
> A. Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky, except as authorized by this Chapter, and the ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, ornamental features and a porte-cochere or canopy which may project a distance not to exceed 18 inches into the required yard.
>
> B. Open or lattice-enclosed fire escapes, outside stairways, and balconies opening upon fire towers, and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues into the rear yard may be permitted by the Building Official for a distance of not more than 5 feet, but only where the same are placed so as not to obstruct light and ventilation.
>
> C. Overhangs and shade control devices which prevent overheating of solar collectors may project a distance not to exceed 48 inches into the required front, rear or street side yard.
>
> D. On double frontage lots the required front yard shall be provided on the portion of the lot abutting each street.
>
> E. Yard Requirement - This requirement is applicable to property in the
>
> non-metropolitan area as delineated in Chapter 8 which is in proximity to expressways, as designated on Core Graphic 10.
>
> 1. No residential structure or noise sensitive use, including schools, libraries or nursing homes shall be located within 250 feet of the edge of pavement of the expressway’s nearest travel lane, including ramps.
>
> 2. Land within the 250 foot zone may be used as dedicated open space, landscaped buffer area, roadways, accessory structures, and private yard area deed restricted from residential structures.
>
> 3. Exceptions to this restriction may only be granted in conformance with the procedures provided below.
>
> F. On land in any zoning and form district, which is subject to the provisions in (E.) above, residential structures and noise sensitive community facilities may be allowed where the following conditions are met and agreed to by the Planning Commission.
>
> 1. A noise impact study, performed by an individual or firm with expertise and experience in the field of traffic noise, is submitted to the Planning Commission. The study must be based upon
>
> projected future traffic data provided by the Planning Commission, and
>
> 2. The study indicates that the noise levels, at the site of proposed construction is or is capable of being reduced to levels less than
>
> 65 dBA (in the form of equivalent sound level, Leq.), by the presence of natural barriers or use of man made barriers; and
>
> 3. If man made barriers are proposed, the Planning Commission finds that:
>
> a. provision has been made for maintenance of any barrier structure in a condition that is safe and effective for noise mitigation, for the duration of the residential use; and
>
> b. the proposed barrier does not create adverse environmental impacts or detract from unique natural areas and areas with significant landscape features; and
>
> c. the proposed barrier is constructed of masonry, synthetic or other long lived materials; wood sound walls are not permissible.
>
> 4. A plan is submitted to and accepted by the Planning Commission incorporating the elements set forth in the study above referenced; and
>
> 5. Schools, libraries and nursing homes may be allowed if it can be demonstrated that sound-proofing measures incorporated in the structure will yield interior noise levels within applicable federal standards.
>
> G. Ramps intended and designed for the use of handicapped persons are allowed to encroach into any required yard in any form district as long as they are constructed in accordance with ADAAG (Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines) standards and the Kentucky Building Code for width, height and materials, and a building permit is issued by the appropriate permitting agency. One ramp for each entrance to the structure shall be permitted. In no case shall this section be construed to permit any other structure (e.g. deck or elevated patio)
>
> to encroach into any required yard. The sole intent of this regulation is to ensure that access to housing for handicapped or disabled persons is
>
> not impeded due to a lack of adequate ramps.
>
> H. Vision Clearance: On corner lots (where a street intersects with another street) in all districts where setbacks are required along the street frontage, no fence, wall, freestanding sign, structure or shrubbery planting shall be permitted that is over two (2) feet in height above the established elevation of the curb level or that is not clear of branches, in the case of plant material, from two (2) to six (6) feet above the established elevation for a distance equal to the respective required yard, not to exceed thirty (30) feet, measured from the point of intersection of the intersecting lot lines and within the triangle formed by connecting the ends of the respective distances.
>
> I. Front Property Line: In determining the depth of a front setback, the front property line shall not be located closer than thirty (30) feet to the center line of a street or highway, excepting streets of less than 60 feet
>
> in width dedicated to public use on a subdivision plat which has the approval of the Commission.
>
> J. When front or street side yards are required in a district in which automobile service stations are permitted, gasoline pump islands and pumps may be placed on the premises provided they are at least 15 feet from the right-of-way line. Where no front or street side yards are required, gasoline pumps and pump islands shall be at least 10 feet from the right-of-way line.
>
> K. In determining compliance with maximum building or structure heights established in this Code, height of principal structures shall be measured from grade at the front and street side of the building or structure to the highest point of the coping of a flat or mansard roof; or to the mean
>
> height level between eaves and ridge for gable, hip or gambrel roofs; or to the mean height level between highest and lowest portion of a rooftop parapet wall. In the Traditional Neighborhood, Traditional Marketplace Corridor and Traditional Workplace Form Districts, when proposed development entails change in grade in areas of existing development patterns, the height of a building or structure shall be measured from the mean elevation of the established grade of abutting parcels, excluding public or private rights-of-way, to ensure that the scale of the new structure(s) or building(s) is compatible with existing structure(s) or building(s). The height of accessory structures shall be measured in the same manner as principal structures, using the average grade at the wall of the structure closest to a property line. (Refer to Section 4.4.3.A.1 for measurement of fence height.)
>
> **5.1.8 Maximum Setback**
>
> A. Maximum setback standards are established for various form districts in Chapter 5 Parts 2 and 3. Maximum setbacks shall apply to all street frontages.
>
> B. The maximum setback requirement shall be satisfied when 60% of the lot frontage adjacent to the street(s) is occupied by building(s) between the maximum setback line and minimum setback line. Once the 60% standard is met, further development is not subject to the maximum setback. This requirement applies to multi-family residential and any non-residential development. Additions that do not extend the building wall adjacent to a street frontage shall be exempt from the maximum setback.
>
> **The following diagrams provide common illustrations of building placement and the application of the maximum setback standards as described in section 5.1.8.**

***NOTE:** Height restrictions apply to building façade on front and street side (for corner lots). Walk- out basements at the rear will not count toward building*

>
> *Street Wall – “A vertical plane at the right-of-way line created by the façade of a*
>
> *structure or series of structures along a given block face.”*
>
> B. Intent and Applicability
>
> The Downtown Form District (DFD) is intended to promote the development and redevelopment of the downtown area in a manner consistent and compatible with the unique and diverse design elements of Louisville’s downtown. It will create a downtown with a compact, walkable core and a lively and active pedestrian environment that fosters and increases the number of people walking and to ensure a more humane downtown environment. DFD design standards are also intended to promote the downtown as a unique and active destination with a variety of land uses, including residential uses, designed in
>
> context with the area in which they are located.
>
> C. Dimensional Standards
>
> Dimensional standards have been established to ensure that buildings are of an appropriate mass and scale that provides continuity to their surroundings, allow for adequate penetration of sunlight and air, and relate well to the pedestrian environment.
>
> 1. Minimum Lot Size, Depth, and Width – There are no minimum lot size, depth, and width requirements in the Downtown Form District except lots developed exclusively for single family detached residential use shall comply with the size and width requirements established in Section 5.2.2, Traditional Neighborhood Form District Design Standards.
>
> 2. Building Location – A street wall**,** at least 3 stories in height, shall be maintained for the length(s) of the lot frontage(s) through the placement of the principal structure or extension(s) of its façade(s), such as colonnades.
>
> The building facade may recede from the street wall by as much as 18” to allow for columns or other architectural elements as parts of the street wall.
>
> May 2011 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE 5.2-1
>
> 3. Building Setbacks – A setback, not to exceed 15 feet measured from the right-of-way, is permitted provided no less than 60% of the street wall is maintained. Recesses on the ground floor to accommodate entry ways, display windows, planters, or similar features shall not be considered as setbacks provided the upper stories have been built to the street wall.
>
> 4. When new construction creates structures with adjoining setbacks, the structures will be considered as one building in calculating the 60% street wall minimum. (see Illustration below.)
>
> ![](./media/image14.jpeg)ROW
>
> At Least 60% of the Street Wall Must be Maintained.
>
> 5. Multiple Structure Lots and New Block Face Developments – A **street wall** shall be maintained along the entire lot frontage through the placement of one or more structures. Where new development extends along the entire block face between two primary streets, except in Special Districts, the new street wall may be established at a setback from the right-of-way line not to exceed 10 feet or a maximum sidewalk width of 20 feet, whichever is less, provided (a) the street wall setback is uniformly maintained along the entire block frontage through the placement of one or more structures and (b) the sidewalk extends to the street wall.
>
> 6. Except as provided above for new block face developments, all corner lots within the Downtown Form District shall maintain a zero foot setback from the street wall for at least 50 feet from the intersection along each street, or the width of the lot, whichever is less.
>
> 7. Special Districts – A zero-foot building setback shall be maintained for all structures constructed within the Main/Market and Core/Broadway districts.
>
> D. Building Mass and Form – To allow adequate light and air to reach the street level, structures over 14 stories shall **step back** from the street wall as follows:

| Number of Stories   | Minimum Step Back From Street Wall           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 14 or less          | 0                                            |
| 15-18               | 15'                                          |
| 19-22               | 25'                                          |
| &gt;22              | Additional 10’ added after every 4th floor   |

> Example: The 32nd floor of a building would have to be set back a minimum of 55’ -- 25’ for the first 22 floors+ 10’ for next 4 floors (23-26) + 10’ for next 4 floors (27-30) + 10’ (floors 31-34) = 55’

> *Building Step Back/Separation*
>
> 1. Step back provisions, except in Special Districts, shall not be applicable to the extent that, as a consequence of such provisions, the maximum possible gross floor area for any floor would be less than 9,000 square feet.
>
> 2. Multiple structures – Multiple structures located on a single lot shall be designed so the **building height** of any structure is at least equal to the height of any other structure on the lot located between it and the right-of-way.
>
> 3. Special Districts –
>
> a. A building step back shall be incorporated into all new structures as necessary within the Main/Market District to emphasize the prevailing historic cornice line on that block.
>
> b. Reserved (other standards may be developed regulating building heights within other special districts – e.g. Core/Broadway District.)
>
> Building Separation/Openings - In order to maintain sunlight and reduce shadows, to minimize adverse impact to the microclimate, and to encourage appropriate scale and density in the Downtown Form District, buildings over 200 feet or 14 stories proposed on the same block shall be separated from each other by a distance greater than or equal to the
>
> right-of-way width of the nearest public street.
>
> The DFD standards shall be applied to the downtown core and surrounding environs within the district, as set forth in Table 5.2.1 below. The standards address the building structures and their relationship to the street with emphasis on the streetscape experience.

> B. Intent and Applicability
>
> The Traditional Neighborhood Form District (TNFD) is intended to promote the development and redevelopment of neighborhoods in a manner consistent and compatible with the distinct site and community design elements of a traditional neighborhood. TNFD
>
> design standards are also intended to promote the establishment of a mixture of uses that effectively integrate retail, office, insitutional, and other non-residential uses within traditional neighborhoods in a manner that provides high quality and convenient service to
>
> residents while protecting the character of the neighborhood.
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to encourage that new development within the TNFD is consistent with a traditional neighborhood pattern and form of development, promoting as applicable:
>
> 1. Appropriate and compatible integration of residential, civic, commercial and office uses that promote close-to-home shopping and service opportunities;
>
> 2. Parks and open space resources convenient to neighborhood residents;
>
> 3. Alternative modes of travel including public transit amenities;
>
> 4. Compatible infill development whether residential or commercial;
>
> 5. Inclusive housing opportunities; and
>
> 6. High quality design of individual sites.
>
> The TNFD standards may be applied to both existing neighborhoods and proposals to create new neighborhoods. The standards address both the internal site design elements of a development (e.g., building location, design, and orientation) and the relationship of the development to the surrounding community context (e.g., relationship to the adjacent street/sidewalk network).
>
> C. Lot Dimensional Standards
>
> 1. Infill Standards – Non-Residential and Mixed Use Development Where 50% or more of the linear street frontage within the same or opposing block face is occupied by principal structures exhibiting site design consistent with a traditional development pattern, the following additional standards shall apply:
>
> a. Front Setback/Build-to Line and Street Sideyards. Where there are highly uniform setback/build-to lines (at least 50% of the structures on the block face have setbacks that vary by 10% or less), the setback/build-to line for the new structure shall be the average setback of existing structures in the block face. Where there is more than 10% variation in setbacks within the block face, the setback/build-to line shall fall within the range of the setbacks of the nearest constructed properties. Exception: Corner buildings with non-residential and mixed uses shall use Table 5.2.2.
>
> b. Building Height. The maximum building height shall be 45 feet or 3.5 stories unless an adjacent building is taller in which case the proposed structure may be as tall as the tallest adjacent building.
>
> c. Sites that do not qualify as Infill Sites shall be developed in accordance with Table 5.2.2.
>
> 2. Infill Standards – Residential Development
>
> See Chapter 5 Part 4 Residential Site Design Standards for traditional form districts (Section 5.4.1)
>
> Dimensional standards for development that is not in an Infill Context are listed in Table 5.2.2 below. Lots created after the effective date of this Land Development Code shall meet the minimum area requirements of Table 5.2.2. Residential lots having less area than required and legally created prior to the adoption of these regulations may be occupied by one dwelling unit. For lot dimensional standards for Conservation Subdivisions see Table 7.11.1.

> **5.2.3 Traditional Marketplace Corridor Form District**
>
> A. Traditional Marketplace Corridors (TMC) are characterized by older, pedestrian-scale development along major roadways adjacent to traditional neighborhoods. The corridors typically contain a wide variety of land uses (retail, restaurants, office, institutional and residential) that range from low to medium intensity. Buildings along the corridor are often narrow, closely spaced or attached, and built out to or near the street with display windows and wide sidewalks in front. Parking is usually provided on the street or in parking lots located at the rear of lots. Commercial corridor development is closely integrated with adjacent
>
> neighborhoods through side street connections and alleys, which typically delineate the boundaries between corridors and traditional
>
> neighborhoods, running along rear lot lines. The corridors have a high
>
> degree of pedestrian and transit use. Examples include Frankfort
>
> Avenue and portions of Broadway, Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue.
>
> B. Relationship To The Comprehensive Plan
>
> The Traditional Marketplace Corridor Form District (TMCFD) implements the following Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive Plan Goals and Objectives:

> C. Intent
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to ensure that new development within the TMCFD is consistent with the traditional pattern of development within the district. Standards are included to promote:
>
> ![](./media/image17.png) Development that reinforces the corridor’s traditional visual
>
> ![](./media/image18.png)character, function, and identity;
>
> Alternative modes of travel;
>
> Linkages between commercial development within the corridor and adjacent residential uses;
>
> ![](./media/image17.png) Compatibility between corridor development and adjacent neighborhoods; and
>
> ![](./media/image17.png) High quality design of individual sites.
>
> D. Dimensional Standards
>
> 1. Minimum Lot Size, Depth, and Width. There are no minimum lot size, depth, and width requirements in the TMCFD, except as specified in Section 5.5.1.
>
> 2. Residential Development Standards. Residential lots and structures (both principal and accessory) shall comply with the Traditional Neighborhood Form District standards listed in Section
>
> 5.2.2.
>
> 3. Non-residential/Mixed Use Structure Setback/Build to Line
>
> a. Front Setback/Build-to Line and Street Side Yards. There is no minimum front setback/build-to line or street side yard. The maximum front setback/build-to line and street side yards shall be no greater than 15 feet from the line of the right-of-way.
>
> Exceptions: –
>
> i. Infill Context. The setback line shall either be;
>
> (a) fall within the range of the setbacks of the two nearest constructed properties.
>
> (b) buildings may be constructed at the existing right-of- way/sidewalk line (i.e., with no front or street side yard setbacks).
>
> ii. Corner Lots: See 5.5.1.A.2
>
> iii. Outdoor seating areas. Outdoor amenities such as open, unenclosed seating areas are permitted to encroach into the front setback as long as the corner requirements of Section
>
> 5.5.1 A,

> **5.2.4 Town Center Form District**
>
> A. The Town Center Form District (TCFD) represents a traditional pattern of development in Louisville and Jefferson County. Town centers are typically compact areas with a mixture of moderately intense uses that
>
> are developed around an identifiable core. They are often located at a historic crossroads or at the intersection of a major thoroughfare and collector roadway with connections to surrounding neighborhoods. Buildings are close to and oriented toward the street, and there is a connected street pattern, shared parking and pedestrian amenities. More intense commercial and residential uses are located in proximity to major thoroughfares, and the intensity of uses gradually declines toward an “edge” or “transition area” to lower density residential neighborhoods.

> B. Intent and Applicability
>
> The provisions of this Part are intended to ensure that new development within the TCFD is consistent with the established and desired pattern and characteristics of development within the district, promoting the following, as applicable:
>
> 1. An identifiable core located at community crossroads;
>
> 2. A mixture of moderately intense uses including civic, shopping, restaurants, offices and residences;
>
> 3. A focal point for several neighborhoods and/or incorporated municipalities;
>
> 4. A high level of roadway, transit, bicycle and pedestrian access;
>
> 5. Special attention should be given to the compatibility of infill and redevelopment of both individual and integrated sites; and
>
> 6. Establishment of new town centers requires a high level of planning and design.
>
> C. Dimensional Standards
>
> size, depth, and width requirements in the TCFD, except as specified in paragraph b., below.
>
> 2. Residential Lots and Building Setbacks. Residential lots and structures (both principal and accessory structures) shall comply with the Traditional Neighborhood Form District Standards in Section 5.2.2 or shall comply with Nonresidential/Mixed Use Standards below.
>
> 3. Non-Residential and Mixed Use Structure Setbacks.
>
> a. Front Setback/Build-to line and Street Side Yards. There is no minimum front setback/build-to line or street side yard. The maximum front setback/build-to line and street side yard shall be no greater than 15 feet from the edge of right-of-way.
>
> b. Front Setback/Build-to line and Street Side yard – Infill Context.
>
> Where at least 50% of the street frontage (linear distance) within the same block face is occupied by principal structures, the setback/build-to line shall fall within the range of setbacks of the nearest two constructed properties or 15 feet, whichever is less.
>
> c. Corner Lots: See 5.5.1.A.2
>
> d. Outdoor seating areas. Open, unenclosed public seating or similar areas, fountains and outdoor amenities are permitted to encroach into the front setback as long as the corner requirements are met.
>
> e. Side Yard Setback. The minimum setback shall be either of the following:
>
> i. There are no side yard setbacks except where adjacent to a residential use or zoning district, in which case a minimum side yard setback of 5 feet shall be maintained.
>
> ii. If the site is located at the edge of the TCFD, the depth of the required form district transition area/buffer yard must be maintained.
>
> f. Rear Yard Setback. Minimum 5 feet from rear property line.
>
> The rear setback shall be the depth of the required form district transition area buffer yard if the site is located in the Form
>
> District Edge/Transition Zone.
>
> *See Section 5.7.1 for standards applicable in the transition zone.*
>
> g. Building Height.
>
> i. Except as limited within the Form District Transition Zone, the maximum permitted building height is 120 feet.
>
> frontage within the same or opposing block face is occupied by the principal structures exhibiting site design consistent with a traditional development pattern, the following additional standards shall apply:
>
> (a) Where there are highly uniform building heights (at least
>
> 50 percent of the structures on the block face have building heights that vary by 10 percent or less), the building height of the new structure shall fall within 10 percent of the average height.
>
> (b) Where there is more than 10 percent variation in building heights within the block face, the building heights of new buildings shall fall within the range of the building heights of the two nearest constructed properties.
>
> Town CenterThreshold Table

> **5.2.5 Traditional Workplace Form District**
>
> The Traditional Workplace Form District (TWFD) applies to older established industrial and employment areas that contain primarily small-to-medium scale industrial and employment uses. These uses are often historically integrated with or adjacent to residential neighborhoods, especially traditional neighborhoods. District standards are designed to encourage adaptive reuse and investment in these areas while ensuring compatibility with adjacent uses and form districts, to ensure adequate access and transit service, and to retain distinctive land uses and patterns such as connected street grids.
>
> A. Relationship To The Comprehensive Plan
>
> The TWFD implements the following Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive
>
> Plan Goals and Objectives:

| Goals                                 | Objectives                                                                                               | Plan Elements              |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Community Form Goals G1, G2, G3, G4   | Community Form Objectives G1.1, G2.1, G2.2, G2.3, G2.4, G2.5, G3.1, G3.2, G3.3, G4.1, G4.2, G4.3, G4.4   | Guidelines 1, 3, 6, 7, 9   |

> B. Intent and Applicability
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to promote high quality design that is compatible with adjacent non-workplace uses. The TWFD often must accommodate relatively large volumes of traffic and parking while also providing for alternative travel modes.
>
> Standards are included to promote:
>
> 1. Compatibility with adjacent form districts and non-workplace uses;
>
> 2. Adequate access for employees, freight, and products;
>
> 3. Alternative modes of travel;
>
> 4. High quality design of individual and integrated sites; and
>
> 5. A mixture of uses on a site especially employee-serving commercial businesses (e.g., day care centers, auto-servicing, dry cleaners and restaurants).
>
> C. Dimensional Standards
>
> 1. Lot Size, Depth, and Width. There are no minimum lot size, depth, and width requirements in the TWFD, except as specified in number 2 below.
>
> 2. Residential Development Standards. Residential lots and structures (both principal and accessory structures) shall comply with the Traditional Neighborhood Form District Standards in Section 5.2.2.
>
> 3. Standards Applicable Within the Form District Edge/Transition Zone. For sites that are within the 200 foot Form District Edge/Transition Zone the following standards shall apply:
>
> a. Front and Street Side Yard Setback/Build-to line. The maximum setback/build-to line shall be 25 feet. Exception: Infill context. If 50 percent or more of the street frontage (linear distance) within either the same or adjacent block face is occupied by principal structures that have a front setback that vary no more than 10 percent, then new principal structure setback/build-to lines shall fall within that 10 percent. There is no minimum setback/build-to line.
>
> b. Side Yard Setback/Build-to line. None, except where the site abuts an existing residential or office use in which case the minimum side yard setback shall equal the setback of the adjacent use.
>
> c. Rear Yard Setback. Minimum 20 feet.
>
> d. Building Height. Maximum 45 feet or three stories; however if the two nearest non-residential structures are greater than 45 feet or three stories, the infill structure may equal the height of the existing structures.
>
> e. Corner Lots: See 5.5.1.A.2
>
> 4. Standards Applicable Outside the Form District Edge Transition Zone. For sites in the TWFD that are not within the Form District Edge Transition Zone the following standards shall apply:
>
> a. Front and Street Side Yard Setback/Build-to line. The maximum front and street side yard setback/build-to line shall be 25 feet from the front property line. There is no minimum setback/build-to line.
>
> b. Building Height. Maximum 45 feet or three stories; however, additional height may be added provided that the building is stepped back one foot on all sides for each additional foot of building height.
>
> c. Corner lots: See 5.5.1.A.2
>
> 5. Greater Front and Street Side Yard setbacks necessary to comply with applicable parkway or other buffer requirements set forth in Chapter 10 Landscaping, Buffering, and Open Space shall supercede these setback requirements.
>
> 6. Non-residential Structure Side and Rear Setback/Build-to lines.
>
> There are no requirements for side or rear setback/build-to lines. Exception: where an industrial use abuts an existing residential or office use, the setback standards for the CM zone in the Traditional Neighborhood Form District (Table 5.2.2) shall apply.
>
> Traditional Workplace Threshold Table
>

> **5.2.6 Village Form District - Center**
>
> A. Village Centers: Development in the center of the village offering goods and services at a scale that is appropriate for nearby residential areas. Villages within the Village Form District also frequently have an identifiable boundary and/or open space at the edge.
>
> The VFD is a form typical of outlying communities in Jefferson County that developed as scattered independent population growth centers prior to 1940. For this reason, villages typically have development patterns, particularly in the village centers, which reflect pre-World War II design elements. These may include connected and narrow streets and walkways, compact centers with a variety of village-serving uses, and designated sites for civic, historic, and cultural buildings, surrounded by rural lot patterns and a green belt.

> C. Intent and Applicability
>
> The Village Form District (VFD) is broadly characterized as having a range of low to medium density residential uses in outlying areas integrated with shops, services and offices in the form of Village Centers. A Village Form District may have more than a single center. Building design in the Village Centers respects a traditional pattern of
>
> development in which buildings blend with the character of the landscape and pedestrian mobility is prominent.
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to ensure that new development within the VFD is consistent with the established and desired pattern and characteristics of development within the district.
>
> D. Description of Village Centers
>
> 1. Village Center – This development pattern is intended for mixed-uses within villages. The maximum single building square footage within designated Village Neighborhood Serving centers shall be 70,000 square feet.
>
> 2. Pre-Existing Structures: - Non-residential structures constructed prior to the effective date of the VCFD and exceeding 70,000 square feet in area on the first floor may be expanded with approval of the Planning Commission. The project shall be subject to the Category 3 procedures. In addition to a comp plan and LDC review, the
>
> Planning Commission review of such a request shall focus on the following criteria:
>
> a. The resultant mass and scale of the building is compatible to the surrounding development pattern.
>
> b. The parking and circulation will not adversely impact surrounding development.
>
> c. The resultant building after the addition is in keeping with the intent of the neighborhood form district and is compatible to the overall design of the existing development.
>
> E. Dimensional Standards
>
> Infill developments within the Village Center shall conform to the
>
> Traditional Neighborhood Form District dimensional standards.
>
> Dimensional standards for development that is not in an Infill Context are listed in Table 5.2.2. Lots created after the effective date of this Land Development Code shall meet the minimum area requirements of Table
>
> 5.2.2. Residential lots having less area than required and legally created prior to the adoption of these regulations may be occupied by one dwelling unit.
>
> F. Design Standards Village Center
>
> Developments within the Village Center shall conform to the Traditional Neighborhood Form District design standards as listed within the applicable threshold table (See Table 5.2.3 of this part).

> The NFD does not establish permitted land uses, density or intensity of development; refer to the zoning district regulations for applicable restrictions.
>
> B. Neighborhood Form Standards: Intent and Applicability
>
> 1. The Neighborhood Form District (NFD) design standards are intended to promote development and redevelopment that is compatible with and enhances the unique site and community design elements of a neighborhood. NFD design standards are also intended to promote the establishment of activity centers at appropriate locations as established in Guidelines 1 and 2 of the Comprehensive Plan. Activity centers should effectively integrate a mix of retail, insitutional, and other non-residential uses within neighborhoods in a manner that provides convenient service to residents while protecting the character of the neighborhood.
>
> 2. The provisions of this section are intended to promote new development within the NFD that is consistent with a neighborhood pattern and form of development, including as applicable:
>
> a. Appropriate and compatible integration of residential, civic, commercial, office and service uses that promotes close to home shopping and service opportunities;
>
> b. Integrated activity centers rather than stand-alone shopping centers;
>
> c. Park and open space resources convenient to neighborhood residents;
>
> d. Alternative modes of travel and connectivity of neighborhoods, minimizing the use of collectors and major thoroughfares for short trips;
>
> February 2012 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE 5.3-1
>
> e. Compatible infill development, both residential and non- residential;
>
> f. Inclusive housing opportunities; and
>
> g. High-quality design of both individual and integrated sites.
>
> 3. The NFD standards apply to both existing neighborhoods and proposals to create new neighborhoods. The standards address both the internal site design elements of a development (e.g., building location, design, and orientation) and the relationship of the development to the surrounding community context (e.g., relationship to the adjacent street/sidewalk network).
>
> C. Dimensional Requirements
>
> 1. Infill Site Context
>
> a. Where 50% or more of either the lots or street frontage (lineal distance) within 200 feet of the subject site and on the same side of the street are occupied by principal structures, the following requirements apply instead of applicable standards in Tables 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.
>
> *NOTE: There are no infill standards for rear yard setbacks for residential development, refer to Table5.3.1 for required rear yard setbacks for residential development.*
>
> i. See Section 5.4.2 (Residential Site Design Standards) for residential infill standards.
>
> ii. New non-residential structures shall be located at the lesser of the established building pattern (average front and street side setback) or the maximum front and street side setback defined in Table 5.3.2.
>
> iii.. The Infill Site Context standards shall not apply if two properties within 200 feet of the subject site and on the same side of the street is developed at a density less than one dwelling per acre.
>
> 2. Dimensional standards for residential development in each zoning district are listed in Table 5.3.1 below. For lot dimensional standards for Conservation Subdivisions see Table 7.11.1.

> **5.3.2 SUBURBAN MARKETPLACE CORRIDOR DISTRICT**
>
> The design of the Suburban Marketplace Corridor Form District (SMCFD) is characterized by linear commercial development along major roadways. The Suburban Marketplace Corridor is a medium to high density district, with a mixture of highway commercial uses, shopping centers, and office development. Buildings along the corridor are typically set back from the roadway with parking lots in front. Examples of Suburban Marketplace Corridors include Hurstbourne Parkway, Dixie Highway, and Preston Highway.
>
> The SMCFD standards do not address permitted land uses and density or intensity of development. These aspects of land use planning are more appropriately addressed through zoning district regulations or regulatory goals, and objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
>
> **A. RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN**
>
> The SMCFD implements the following Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive
>
> Plan Goals and Objectives:

> **B. INTENT AND APPLICABILITY**
>
> The provisions of this part are intended to promote high quality design and a more visually attractive environment in the SMCFD, accommodating relatively large volumes of traffic while providing for alternative travel modes. Standards are included to promote:
>
> 1. Development that enhances the corridor's visual character, function, and identity;
>
> 2. Alternative modes of travel;
>
> 3. Linkages between commercial and residential uses;
>
> 4. Compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods; and
>
> 5. High quality design of individual sites.
>
> C. Dimensional Standards
>
> 1. Lot Size, Depth, and Width – There are no minimum lot size, depth, and width requirements in the SMCFD, except that residential uses shall comply with the Neighborhood Form District Standards in Table 5.3.1.
>
> ***NOTE:** The setback requirement will ensure that new construction is situated outside the expanded right-of-way standards created by the Land Development Code.*
>
> 2. Building Setbacks
>
> a. Front and Street-Side Setback – Structures on parcels with public street frontage shall be setback from the street center line no less than one-half of the standard right-of-way width for the functional class of the abutting street, as specified in Chapter 6 Part 2 of these regulations. In addition, structures, parking and other improvements shall maintain setbacks as required to comply with applicable parkway or other buffer requirements set forth in Chapter 10 (Tree Canopy, Landscaping, and Open Space). Principal structures on the lot shall be setback no more than 275 feet from the front and
>
> street-side property lines (alternatives to the maximum setback can be found within Section 5.1.8).
>
> b. Side and Rear Setback – None, except a 25 foot minimum setback shall be provided along the common boundary when a non-residential use abuts a residential zone or a structure(s) with first floor residential use. A minimum setback of 50 feet
>
> shall be provided where a building façade with loading docks for tractor trailers faces a residential use or zone. Vehicular
>
> parking and maneuvering are not permitted in the setbacks. The side and rear setback shall be landscaped in accordance with the buffering requirements of Chapter 10.
>
> 3. Building Height - The maximum permitted height is sixty feet.
>
> 4. Multiple Principal Structures Setbacks – Common wall construction is permissible.
>
> Principal detached structures on the same or adjacent lot shall maintain separations as follows:
>
> a. Building wall has primary entrance or exit – 25 feet.
>
> b. Building wall has secondary entrance or exit – 20 feet. c. Building wall has no entrance or exit – 10 feet.
>
> D. Suburban Marketplace Threshold Table
>
> The following standards shall apply to all developments meeting the thresholds and applicability requirements set forth in Table 5.3.4 below.
>
> **Expansion of existing and creation of new residential structures or units, and creation of residential lots shall be subject to the standards of the Neighborhood Form District (Section 5.3.1).**

> **5.3.3 Regional Center Form District**
>
> The Regional Center Form District (RCFD) encompasses the community’s major shopping facilities. Medium and high intensity commercial development serving a regional market are found in this district. A wide range of related uses, including residential, office and institutional development, is strongly encouraged within Regional Center Form Districts. Mixed uses within a principal building on the site. (e.g., commercial and residential) are supported. District standards are designed to ensure compatibility with adjacent form districts, to ensure a high level of access by a variety of travel modes, to encourage full development of regional centers, and to promote high quality design.

> B. Intent and Applicability
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to promote high quality design and a more visually attractive environment in the RCFD, accommodating relatively large volumes of traffic while providing for alternative travel modes. Standards are included to promote:
>
> 1. Compatibility with adjacent form districts;
>
> 2. Medium to high intensity commercial development and a mix of related uses
>
> 3. High level of access by a variety of modes of travel; and
>
> 4. High quality design of individual and integrated sites. C. Dimensional Standards
>
> 1. Lot Size and Width – There are no minimum lot size and width requirements in the RCFD, except that structures with first floor residential uses shall comply with the Neighborhood Form Districts Standards (Section 5.3.1).
>
> 2. Building Setbacks
>
> a. Front and Street-Side Setback – Structures on parcels with public street frontage shall be setback from the street center line no less than one-half of the right-of-way width for the functional class of the abutting street, as specified in Chapter 6
>
> Part 2 of these regulations. In addition, structures, parking and other improvements shall maintain setbacks as required to comply with applicable parkway or other buffer requirements set forth in Chapter 10 (Landscaping, Buffering, and Open Space). Principal structures on the lot shall be setback no more than
>
> 275 feet from the front and street-side property lines (alternatives to the maximum setback can be found within Section 5.1.8).
>
> b. Side and Rear Setback – None, except where adjacent to a residential zoning district or structure with residential use on the first floor, in which case a minimum setback of 50 feet shall be maintained. Vehicular parking and maneuvering are not permitted in the side and rear setbacks
>
> c. Building Height – Except as limited within the Form District Transition Zone (Chapter 5 Part 7), the maximum permitted height is 150 feet.
>
> d. Multiple Principal Structures Setback – Common wall construction is permissible. Principal structures on the same or adjacent lots constructed as detached buildings shall maintain the following minimum separations:
>
> i. Building wall has primary entrance or exit: 25 feet
>
> ii. Building wall has secondary entrance or exit: 20 feet iii. Building wall has no entrance or exit: 10 feet
>
> Regional Center Threshold Table 5.3.5
>
> The following parts of chapter 5 listed in the threshold table, shall apply to all developments meetingthe thresholds and applicability requirements set forth in Table 5.3.5 below.
>
> Expansion of existing and creation of new residential structures or units, and creation of residential lots shall be subject to the standards of the Neighborhood Form District (Section 5.3.1).

> **5.3.4 Suburban Workplace Form District**
>
> A. The Suburban Workplace Form District (SWFD) is designed to reserve land for large-scale industrial and employment uses in suburban locations. District standards are designed to ensure compatibility with adjacent form districts, to buffer heavy industrial uses from potentially incompatible uses, to ensure adequate access for employees, freight, and products, to provide services and amenities for employees, and to improve transit service.
>
> The SWFD standards do not address permitted land uses and density or intensity of development. These aspects of land use planning are more appropriately addressed through zoning district regulations or regulatory goals, and objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
>
> B. Relationship To The Comprehensive Plan
>
> The SWFD implements the following Cornerstone 2020 Comprehensive
>
> Plan Goals and Objectives:

| **Goals**                             | **Objectives**                                                                                           | **Plan Elements**       |

> C. Intent and Applicability
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to promote high quality design and a more visually attractive environment in the SWFD, accommodating relatively large volumes of traffic while providing for alternative travel modes. Standards are included to promote:
>
> 1. Adequate access for employees, freight,and products;
>
> 2. Alternative modes of travel;
>
> 3. High quality design of individual and itegrated sites;
>
> 4 A wide range of employee-serving commercial businesses (e.g., day care centers, auto servicing, cleaners, restaurants, etc.); and
>
> 5. A mix of uses (e.g., industrial, office, and commercial) within a principal building on the site.
>
> D. Dimensional Requirements
>
> 1. Lot Size, Depth, and Width – There are no minimum lot size,
>
> depth, and width requirements in the SWFD, except as specified in paragraph 2., below.
>
> 2. Residential Lots and Building Setbacks – Residential lots shall comply with the size and width requirements and residential structures (both principal and accessory structures, new construction and expansion) shall comply with the setback requirements established in the Neighborhood Form District Standards (Section 5.3.1).
>
> 3. Non-Residential Building Setbacks
>
> a. Front and Street-Side Setback –Twenty-five feet along all frontage on public streets and private access easements providing primary access. Greater setbacks necessary to comply with applicable parkway or other buffer requirements set forth in Chapter 10 (Landscaping, Buffering, and Open Space) shall supersede these setback requirements. Off- street parking, maneuvering for parking areas, drive-ways, and sidewalks shall be permitted within the 25 foot setback as long as all landscaping requirements of Chapter 10 Part

> ***NOTE:** Maximum height within 200 feet of a Neighborhood form would be 45 feet.*
>
> b. Side Yard – None. c. Rear Yard – None.
>
> d. Adjacent to Residential – Refer to Chapter 5 Part 5.
>
> 4. Building Height
>
> a. The maximum permitted height is 50 feet; however, additional height may be added provided that the building is stepped back one foot on all sides for each additional four feet of building height. Refer to Chapter 5 Part 7 for permissible heights in form district transition zones.
>
> b. Multiple Principal Structures Setbacks **–** Common wall construction is permissible. Principal structures on the same or adjacent lots constructed as detached buildings shall maintain the following minimum separations:
>
> i. Building wall has primary entrance or exit – 25 feet
>
> ii. Building wall has secondary entrance or exit – 20 feet iii. Building wall has no entrance or exit – 10 feet

> **5.3.5 Campus Form District**
>
> The Campus Form District (CFD) is clearly represented in both historic and modern patterns of development within the Louisville and Jefferson County. The University of Louisville-Belknap Campus, Southern Baptist Seminary, and Bellarmine University are some of the historic examples of this form. Modern
>
> examples of the form include the Hurstbourne Green/Forest Green complex and the Shelby Campus of the University of Louisville.
>
> The Campus Form District (CFD) is an established or proposed pattern of development having a mixture of uses clustered for a single or predominant purpose. Residential or commercial uses should primarily serve the people who work or live on the Campus. The form should be compact and walkable, with substantial open space, central gathering areas, shared parking and signage, and an internal circulation system.

> B. Intent and Applicability
>
> The provisions of this Part are intended to promote new development within the CFD that is consistent with the established and desired pattern and characteristics of development within the district, promoting as applicable:
>
> • Development that reinforces the traditional pattern characterized by clusters of individual buildings surrounded by large open spaces;
>
> • Unique building and site design elements for each campus district;
>
> • Alternative modes of travel and shared parking;
>
> • A high level of pedestrian access and amenities;
>
> • High quality design of buildings and spaces.
>
> C. Dimensional Requirements
>
> 1. Minimum Lot Size, Depth, and Width – There are no minimum lot size, depth, and width requirements in the CFD, except as specified in paragraph B., below.
>
> 2. Residential Lots and Building Setbacks - Residential lots shall comply with the size and width requirements and residential structures (both principal and accessory structures) shall comply with the setback requirements established in the Traditional Neighborhood Form District Standards (Section 5.2.2) or Neighborhood Form District Standards (Section 5.3.1). The determination for which set of standards is applicable shall be the choice of the applicant, when the development site does not abut a Traditional Neighborhood or Neighborhood Form District However, when the proposed development site abuts a Traditional Neighborhood or Neighborhood Form District the applicable standards of the adjacent district shall apply.
>
> 3. Non-Residential Building Setbacks
>
> a. Front and Street-Side Setback – 50 feet along public streets or expressways that form the perimeter of the form district, and 25 feet along public streets and private access easements internal to the form district.
>
> b. Side Setback – There is no minimum requirement except where adjacent to a residential use or zoning district, in which case a minimum side setback of 20 feet shall be maintained.
>
> c. Rear Setback – The minimum setback shall be 20 feet. Sites within a form district transition zone shall meet the setback requirement of the adjacent form or 20 feet, whichever is greater.
>
> d. Building Height -– 150 feet; however, if located in a form district transition zone, the maximum height shall be as defined in Section 5.7.1 B1.
>
> e. Multiple Principal Structure Setbacks – Common wall construction is permissible. Principal structures on the same or adjacent lots constructed as detached buildings shall maintain the following minimum separations:
>
> i. Building wall has primary entrance or exit - 25 feet.
>
> iii. Building wall has secondary entrance or exit – 20 feet. iii. Building wall has no entrance or exit: - 10 feet.
>
> **D. Residential and Support Uses**
>
> 1. Residential Use - Up to 25 percent of any development site may be allocated to residential development without any corresponding decrease in the maximum allowable square footage or intensity of non-residential uses allowed in the underlying zone district, provided that all other development standards set forth in this code are complied with. Calculation of permissible residential density shall be based on the net site area, regardless of the amount of
>
> non-residential floor area constructed on the site.
>
> 2. Incentives for Support Services – Principal structures within the CFD used for office, educational or institutional purposes may devote up to five percent of the building square footage to retail uses that primarily serve employees and residents of the CFD, without any corresponding decrease in the maximum allowable square footage or intensity of non-residential uses allowed in the underlying zoning district. The parking requirement for these support services shall be 50% of the minimum established in Chapter 9 Part 1 (Parking).
>
> Campus Threshold Table
>
> The following standards shall apply to all developments meeting the thresholds and applicability requirements set forth in Table 5.3.6 below..
>
> Expansion of existing and creation of new residential structures or units, and creation of residential lots shall be subject to the standards of either the Neighborhood Form District (Section 5.3.1) or Traditional Neighborhood Form District (Section 5.2.2), see Section 5.3.5 C.2 for details.

|             |      | The VFD is a form typical of outlying communities in Jefferson County that developed as scattered independent population growth centers prior to 1940. For this reason, villages typically have development patterns, particularly in the village centers, which reflect pre-World War II design elements. These may include connected and narrow streets and walkways, compact centers with a variety of village-serving uses, and designated sites for civic, historic, and cultural buildings, surrounded by rural lot patterns and a green belt.   |

> C Intent and Applicability
>
> The Village Form District (VFD) is broadly characterized as having a range of low to medium density residential uses in outlying areas integrated with shops, services and offices in the form of Village Centers. A Village Form District may have more than a single center. Building design in the Village Centers respects a traditional pattern of
>
> development in which buildings blend with the character of the landscape and pedestrian mobility is prominent..
>
> The provisions of this section are intended to ensure that new development within the VFD is consistent with the established and desired pattern and characteristics of development within the district.
>
> D. Description of Village Outlying Areas
>
> 1. Village Outlying Areas—This development pattern is primarily single family residential and multi-family residential development, with some small scale commercial or office. The maximum building square footage for non-residential uses within the designated outlying areas is 5,000 square feet. EXCEPTION: Institutional uses (schools, churches, etc.) shall not exceed a building footprint of 75,000 square feet).
>
> E. Dimensional Standards Village Outlying Areas
>
> Developments in the Village Outlying Areas shall conform to the
>
> Neighborhood Form District dimensional standards (Table 5.3.1).
>
> F. Design Standards Village Outlying Area
>
> Developments within the Village Outlying Area shall conform to the Neighborhood Form District design standards as listed in the applicable threshold table (See Table 5.3.3 of this part.).
>
> G. Open Space : New major single family residential subdivisons of 25
>
> acres or more and multi-family developments of 50 units or more, located in the Village Outlying Area, shall provide at least 15% of the gross site area in common open space which meets the requirements of Chapter
>
> 10 Part 5. Open space provided to meet this requirement may be used for credit under the Alternative Development Incentives or the development potential of the open space may be transferred to the remainder of the site in accordance with Section 5.12.2.
>
> **5.4.1 Traditional Form Districts (except for DFD)**
>
> Traditional site design pattern. Residential lots in traditional form districts exhibit a distinct pattern of placement of principal and accessory structures, their relationship to streets and alleys, and provision for open areas. To reflect these characteristics, residential lot and building design requirements are described in terms of the following four basic components of a lot or building site: the public realm area, the principal structure area, the private yard area, and the
>
> accessory use/structure area. New and infill context development in the traditional forms shall maintain this pattern.
>
> Alternative Development Standards. Sites developed in accordance with the Alternative Development Incentives regulations (Chapter 4 Part 5) or the Planned Residential District (Section 2.7.3) shall meet the lot and setback dimension standards of 5.2.2.D. instead of the requirements established in Table 5.2.2
>
> A. Table 5.2.2 shall be used for the non-infill requirements related to maximum building height, setbacks/yards, minimum lot size and minimum lot widthas well as paragraphs A through E of this section (excluding infill standards). Where 50% or more of the street frontage (linear distance) within the same block face is occupied by principal structures, Infill Context requirements apply, in addition to the standards of paragraphs A through E of this section. For infill sites, the following standards take the place of applicable standards in Table 5.2.2. General infill standards apply to the following:
>
> ![](./media/image19.png)1. New lots in an Infill Context shall not be less than 80% of the established lot pattern (average lot width and depth) and shall comply with the minimum lot size of the applicable zoning and form districts.
>
> 2. Single Family Residential Tree Requirement
>
> a. Construction of a new single family or duplex structure on a residential lot shall provide at least one Type ‘A’ or two Type
>
> ‘B” trees on the lot. Preservation of existing trees that meet
>
> the required tree type shall fulfill this requirement. Street trees do not fulfill this requirement.
>
> B. Public Realm Area (see figure 5.4.1)
>
> 1. Encroachments/accessory structures. Encroachments and accessory structures are not permitted in the Public Realm except:

***Note**. Public Realm is defined as the area of the lot between the public right-of-way and the front of the principal structure or to the required principal structure setback/build-to line if there is no*

Where sites in different form districts share a common rear property line or are separated by an alley, the rear yard setback of the adjacent property within the Group A form district shall apply.

3. Non-Residential Use – Within the transition zone , one of the following standards shall apply when a non-residential use in a Group B form district adjoins a residential use in a Group A form district:

> a. The property perimeter buffer yard required in Chapter 10 shall be a type C yard or the type specified in Table 10.2.3, whichever is larger. The buffer yard shall meet or exceed the type 3 planting density requirements. Exception: The continuous screen requirement shall not exceed three (3) feet in height when the required buffer is adjacent to a street or alley.
>
> b. Building facades on the side of the Group B property adjoining residential use shall meet the standards for primary facades established in the Group B form district regulation.

4. Lighting – Refer to Section 4.1.3 for restrictions applicable to outdoor lighting relating to the Neighborhood, Traditional Neighborhood and Village form districts.

5. Signs - Reserved

> *NOTE: “Setbacks of the adjacent properties” means the required minimum setbacks of the adjacent group ‘A’ property’s zoning and form district.*

***NOTE:** Type “C” buffer yards vary between 15’ and 35’ depending on the land uses. Type “3” planting density consists of 3*

*trees/100’ and a 6’*

> The following standards are applicable to all form districts. In addition, standards specific to a given form district may apply (listed in 5.8.1 C).
>
> A. Streets/Alleys – Developments that create public and private **streets** or **alleys** shall connect with and provide for the future extension of the community’s street network.
>
> 1. Alleys – Existing back and side alleys shall be retained and used for public access into the development as an alternative means of vehicular, pedestrian and service access. Underused alleys or those in disrepair, as determined by the Director of Works, shall be repaired in conjunction with new development as a means of encouraging future use. Within traditional form districts, cases where no alley currently exists, the possibility of acquiring the needed land to create an alley should be explored. The Works Director or designee will determine which improvements are needed.

|              | B.   | Sidewalks - All developments shall provide sidewalks in the abutting right-of-way to serve the development site (same side of street). Sidewalks shall be provided along all road frontages in accordance with Section 6.2.6. The minimum sidewalk width shall be four (4) feet for local level roads, and five (5) feet for collector and arterial level roadways. The Director of Works may require greater width or, for infill sidewalks connecting existing sidewalks of lesser width, may approve a sidewalk of lesser width upon finding that divergence from the five (5) foot standard is consistent with public safety. If sidewalks are present in the public right- of-way fronting adjacent lots, the location and alignment of the new sidewalk shall connect directly with this existing network.   |         |

>
> d. Landscaped green area with seating e. Outdoor playground area
>
> f. Multi-purpose trails/paths
>
> 2. Any such areas shall be accessible by walkways linking with the various uses within the development and/or with adjacent development. Amenities may be centralized or dispersed, but shall be located no more than 600 feet (measurement based on the pedestrian walkways) from the buildings required to provide the amenities. Outdoor open space may contain food service areas. The outdoor space shall include seating at a rate on not less than 1 seat per 200 square feet of outdoor amenity. To enhance usability, at least 25% of the open space shall be shaded or used for landscaping.
>
> 3. As an applicant option to the requirements set forth above, a fee in lieu of the Outdoor Amenity/Focal Point requirements may be provided with approval of the Planning Commission or designee. The fee in lieu shall be calculated based on the square footage required for the outdoor amenity area multiplied by the per square foot value of the parcel of land, as determined by its actual documented value at the time of development. This fee-in-lieu shall be calculated as part of the development review and payable at the time of building construction permitting. The fee shall be directed to the Louisville Public Space Art Fund. In June of every year, the Mayor’s Commission on Public Art shall come before the
