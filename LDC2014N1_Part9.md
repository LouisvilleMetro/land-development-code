>
> A. Any sign legally in existence on the effective date of any zoning regulation, which does not permit such signs may continue in existence as a matter of right. A nonconforming sign may be maintained and repaired on the same property so long as the area, height, placement of movable parts, and luminosity are not altered to make the sign less in conformance with this regulation. Development sites with a non-conforming sign(s) may not install any additional freestanding signs if an existing freestanding sign is more than twenty (20%) percent nonconforming or any additional attached signs if an existing attached sign is more than twenty (20%) percent nonconforming even if one or more would otherwise be allowed by other provisions of this chapter (Exemption: Existing nonconforming signs designated as a significant sign (see definition in Section 8.1.2) by the Sign Review Board are exempt from

At such time as any structural element of a nonconforming sign is replaced, the sign must be brought into compliance with the requirements of current regulations, except that a nonconforming on-premises sign may be replaced by another nonconforming on-premises sign (exception, this provision does not apply to incidental and temporary on-premises signs), provided that all nonconformance in area, height, size, and setback is reduced by fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the existing nonconforming sign and what the regulation allows. Exception: No reduction in nonconformance shall be required for the replacement of signs, awnings, canopies and marquees that were damaged by a weather event or accident (i.e. vehicular accident) unless the damage results from neglect of maintenance or other willful act of the property owner. Replacement of structural elements in this context means the disassembly and subsequent re-assembly or the substantial alteration of the pole, base, or frame. For awnings and canopies any change to the frame shall be considered as a structural change. The replacement of material covers shall not be considered a structural change.

>
> **8.1.5 Removal Of Certain Nonconforming Signs**
>
> Nonconforming permanent on-premises signs that have been abandoned shall be immediately removed by the sign owner or lessee, or the property owner. There shall be a presumption that a nonconforming on-premises sign has been abandoned in the event that for a period of 360 days, the principal use, which the on-premises sign is associated ceases operation or the use of the sign is discontinued. Upon failure of the sign owner or lessee, or property owner to remove the nonconforming on-premises sign in accordance with this Section, a zoning enforcement officer may issue a written notice to the sign owner or lessee, or property owner ordering that the on-premises sign shall be removed within thirty (30) days. The action of the zoning enforcement officer may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with the provisions in KRS Chapter 100.

> 2. A back-to-back or V-shaped sign constitutes one sign if it has a common set of supports.
>
> If the interior angle between the two sign faces is less than 120 degrees, the sign area is of one sign face only. If the angle between the two sign faces is greater than or equal to
>
> 120 degrees, the sign area is the sum of the areas of the two sign faces.
>
> ![](./media/image2.png)3. No sign shall have more than four faces. Signs with more than two sign faces shall be calculated for compliance with this section in the following manner. The maximum allowable size of each sign face shall be calculated by taking the maximum allowable square footage for a two-sided freestanding sign (from Table 8.3.2 and Table 8.3.2) and dividing it by the total number of sign faces.

First floor awning, canopy and marquee signs are excluded from the number of awning, attached, canopy or
>
> marquee signs permitted on any one façade of a building, subject to the total maximum sign area requirement set forth below in Table 8.3.2; attached signs, canopy signs, marquee signs and awning signs are permitted for all non-residential zoning uses unless otherwise regulated within the form district regulations. Commercial uses permitted within a TNZD district may include attached, awning, canopy or marquee signs as authorized in this section, subject to additional limits established in the applicable TNZD Plan Report.
>
> EXCEPTION: Buildings within the Downtown Form District are not restricted by the number of attached sign limit(s) listed above, however these buildings are subject to the overall attached sign allowance as listed in Table 8.3.2
>
> 2. The total area encompassed by all attached signs on any one facade of the building shall not exceed the limits established in Table 8.3.2, below. The area of the building façade shall be measured as specified in paragraph 3 below.
>
> 3. The area of a façade of a building is determined by adding the square footage of surface area of each section of wall visible from a given perspective. For buildings with more than one wall along one façade (for example, rooms jutting out from the main building or a building where each floor is set back from the floor below), all of the walls are included in the total
>
> area. The total area does not include any roof area.
>
> 4. An attached sign mounted parallel to the exterior walls of a building may project up to eighteen (18) inches from the surface to which it is mounted. An attached sign constructed flat on the face of such building may extend into the right-of-way no further than eighteen (18) inches from the surface of such building without the approval of the Director of the Department of Public Works. An attached sign mounted to a slanted (inclined) exterior surface may be mounted in the vertical upright position as long as the sign does not project beyond eighteen (18) inches at the point of attachment. No attached on-premises sign shall be mounted on any roof.
>
> 5. Traditional Marketplace Corridor Form Districts: Multiple tenant buildings shall be permitted either an attached sign or a projecting sign for each tenant.
>
> 6. Projecting Signs: Buildings on lots which contain no permanent freestanding on- premises sign (other than incidental signs) may not have more than one sign which projects perpendicularly from the facade (but not the roof) of the building providing that the sign does not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area, does not extend below nine (9) feet above the ground or sidewalk, or more than eight (8) feet from the facade of the building, or closer than two (2) feet to the abutting roadway. The area of the projecting sign shall be part of the total allowable signage allowed on any one facade of the building as listed in Table 8.3.2. Multiple use buildings may have one projecting sign for each business, subject to the total maximum sign area permitted in Table 8.3.2. EXCEPTION: Buildings within the Downtown Form District are not restricted by the number of projecting sign limit(s) or the 32 square foot limit listed above, however these buildings are subject to the overall attached sign allowance as listed in Table 8.3.2.
>
> B. Freestanding On-premises Signs: In addition to the attached signs allowed above, illuminated or non-illuminated freestanding business signs are allowed subject to the following restrictions:
>
> 1. Freestanding on-premises signs are allowed for all non-residential uses unless otherwise
>
> restricted within the applicable form district sign restrictions. Commercial uses permitted within a TNZD district may include freestanding business signs in accordance with the restrictions of the Traditional Neighborhood Form District as listed in this section, subject to additional limits established in the applicable TNZD Plan Report.
>
> 2. No freestanding sign shall be located in or project over or into the right-of-way or into any adjoining property.
>
> 3. A lot fronting only on one street shall have no more than one freestanding sign unless the street frontage exceeds 600 feet, then a second freestanding sign is allowed. The sum of the areas of the two freestanding signs combined shall not exceed the total maximum area allowed for one freestanding sign.
>
> 4. A lot fronting on two or more public streets shall be allowed to have one freestanding sign for each street frontage. If one street frontage exceeds 600 feet then a third sign shall be permitted in accordance with paragraph B3 above. If the site contains more than one street frontage with more than 600 feet of length, then only one of the street frontages shall be permitted to have a second sign in accordance with paragraph B3 above.
>
> 5. An off-premises/outdoor advertising sign shall not be counted in determining compliance with items 3 and 4 above.
>
> 6. No lot frontage shall have a freestanding sign unless the building situated on that lot is set back at least fifteen (15) feet from the street right-of-way line. Corner lots may have a freestanding sign for the frontage on which the building is setback at least fifteen (15) feet from the street right-of-way line.
>
> 7. There shall be no minimum setback for a freestanding business sign as long as the sign meets the restrictions listed under Section 8.1.6A. Freestanding business signs shall be permitted in required form district setbacks/yards.
>
> ![](./media/image3.png)8. Where more than one (1) freestanding sign is proposed for
>
> installation on a development site with multiple frontages, a minimum of sixty (60) linear feet shall separate each freestanding sign.
>
> 9. Freestanding on-premises signs for lots adjacent to Scenic Corridors, Olmsted Parkways and Parkways and for lots within the Traditional Marketplace Corridor, Neighborhood, Traditional Neighborhood, Campus and Village Form Districts shall meet one of the following design standards:
>
> a. The sign shall be a monument style sign; or
>
> b. The sign shall be a columnar sign; or
>
> c. In locations where the permit issuer identifies a potential sight distance problem and when the Director of Works determines that the design standards a or b above would negatively affect sight distance necessary for pedestrian and vehicular traffic accessing the site or using adjacent intersections, another sign style may be approved by the Planning Director.
>
> 10. Form District Specific Freestanding Sign Restrictions:
>
> a. Suburban Workplace Form Districts:
>
> i. One freestanding master plan project identification sign shall be permitted adjacent
>
> to the primary entrance to developments having more than five lots and having an access point from an arterial level street. This sign shall not be counted towards the number of allowed freestanding business signs on a lot. The sign shall not exceed 150 square feet in area and 24 feet in height.

>
> A. Authority of the Sign Review Board - The Sign Review Board (SRB) is a joint subcommittee of the Louisville Metro Planning Commission (PC) and the Louisville Metro Board of Zoning Adjustments (BOZA). The Sign Review Board conducts the public hearing/meeting process for all exceptional signage reviews (variance, waiver and special sign authorizations). The SRB reviews exceptional sign requests and makes a recommendation to BOZA or Planning Commission depending on the type of exceptional sign review. The SRB reviews exceptional signage requests against the general variance and waiver guidelines spelled out in the LDC and in KRS 100. The SRB also reviews requests against specific exceptional sign design guidelines which are used to further clarify the general review criteria outlined for variances and waivers. The SRB also reviews requests for the designation of 'significant signs'. The SRB will review a request for 'significant sign' designation and will make a recommendation to BOZA.

> 5. One non-sign industry design professional (e.g. architect, landscape architect, engineer, etc.)
>
> C. Exceptional Signage Review - Exceptional signage reviews are proposals that do not meet the current requirements of the sign regulations or those cases where a certain sign design is not an authorized type of sign. This review cannot authorize sign types or design elements that are prohibited by the sign regulations. The following three types of exceptional signage reviews exist:
>
> 1. Variance Level Reviews - These are reviews for proposed exceptional signage that does not meet a dimensional standard eligible for a variance in accordance with KRS 100 (e.g. Sign area, sign height, sign setback, etc.).
>
> 2. Waiver Level Reviews - These are reviews for proposed exceptional signage that does not meet a design standard established by the sign regulations (e.g. Sign style, LED timing restriction, opaque backgrounds, etc.).
>
> 3. Sign Authorization - These are reviews for proposed exceptional signage that do not meet definitions for sign types authorized by the sign regulations (e.g. angular attached signs, attached signs projecting further than 18 inches, projecting signs that project less than 18 inches from a facade, etc.).
>
> D. Exceptional Signage Review Process - Exceptional signage reviews shall be conducted as follows:
>
> 1. Variance level reviews shall conduct a public hearing and shall provide notice in accordance with chapter 11 of the LDC and KRS 100. The SRB shall conduct the public hearing and shall provide a recommendation to BOZA or PC (in conjunction with a zoning change request). The SRB shall review the request in accordance with the criteria listed in chapter 11 of the LDC and in KRS 100. The Exceptional Sign Review Design Guidelines listed in Appendix 8B of the LDC shall be used to further clarify the standard criteria by providing guidelines more closely related to signs.
>
> 2. Waiver level reviews shall conduct a public meeting and shall provide notice in accordance with chapter 11, part 8 of the LDC. The SRB shall conduct the public meeting and shall provide a recommendation to PC or BOZA (in conjunction with a variance or conditional use permit request).

> **Appendix 8B Design Guidelines for Exceptional Signage Reviews**
>
> The guidelines listed below clarify the general criteria provided in the LDC and in KRS
>
> 100 for variances and LDC waivers. The guidelines provide design questions and standards in order to more closely relate the general variance and waiver criteria to sign design.
>
> **Variance Reviews**
>
> A. Will the proposed sign adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare, will it alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will it cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, or will it allow an unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:
>
> 1. Proposals for sign area and height modifications in excess of 25% of what is permitted by chapter 8 should be carefully scrutinized to ensure compatibility with surrounding development.
>
> 2. The proposed sign is in compliance with the underlying form district as described within Cornerstone 2020, typically the type of neighborhood, character of the area and traffic speeds should be considered in the design of a sign.
>
> 3. The proposed sign should be visually consistent with the architecture, materials, colors and overall design of the building(s) which it identifies.
>
> 4. Generally, all colors, except fluorescent, may be allowable depending on their relationships to architecture, the business, and the surrounding neighborhood.
>
> 5. Signs should have an individual character and should not be designed to mimic signs on adjacent properties.
>
> 6. Signs should be clearly readable, information should be limited.
>
> 7. For attached signage the architectural design of the building may influence the location of the sign on the structure.
>
> 8. Light backgrounds are discouraged on internally illuminated signs because visibility is lowered by a “wrap around” effect.
>
> 9. Signs located within overlay districts and/or local landmarks district should be reviewed in accordance with guidelines of the applicable district.
>
> 11. The scale of signs should be appropriate for the building on which they are
>
> placed and the area in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be proportionate with the scale of the structure.
>
> 12. Because residential and commercial uses generally exist in close proximity, signs should be designed and located so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods.
>
> 13. Place wall signs to establish facade rhythm, scale and proportion where facade rhythm doesn't exist. On buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade, signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion.
>
> 14. Pedestrian-oriented signs are encouraged. It is desirable and encouraged to include a pedestrian-oriented sign as one of the permitted signs for a business. Pedestrian-oriented signs are signs that are designed for and directed toward pedestrians so that they can easily and comfortably read the sign as they stand adjacent to the business.
>
> 15. Select colors carefully. Color is one of the most important aspects of visual communication -- it can be used to catch the eye or to communicate ideas or feelings. Colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity. Even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection. Too many colors used thoughtlessly can confuse and negate the message of a sign.
>
> 16. Use contrasting colors. Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. A substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible.
>
> 17. Limit the number of letter styles. The number of lettering styles should be limited in order to increase legibility. A general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs. Intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate.
>
> 18. Significant signage. The preservation of designated signature signs may be used to justify increases in overall sign area limits as long as the integrity of the signature sign is maintained and any new signage is deemed to be compatible to the signature sign.
>
> B. Whether the requested variance arises from special circumstances which do not
>
> generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone. The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:
>
> 1. Elevation changes between properties and adjacent streets should be reviewed to ensure that signage is appropriately visible to the street;
>
> 2. The transportation department responsible for the adjacent public streets must review the plans for freestanding signs to ensure conformance with safety standards prior to approval by the board
>
> C. Whether the strict application of the provision of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant. The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:
>
> 1. The transportation department responsible for the adjacent public streets must review the plans for freestanding signs to ensure conformance with safety standards prior to approval by the board.
>
> 2. The SRB should review the layout of the land and surrounding property to determine whether relief is warranted.
>
> D. Whether the circumstances are the result of actions taken by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is sought.
>
> **Waiver Reviews**
>
> A. The waiver will not adversely affect adjacent property owners. The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:
>
> 1. The proposed sign should be visually consistent with the architecture, materials, colors and overall design of the building(s) which it identifies.
>
> 2. Generally, all colors, except fluorescent, may be allowable depending on their relationships to architecture, the business, and the surrounding neighborhood.
>
> 3. Signs should have an individual character and should not be designed to mimic signs on adjacent properties.
>
> 4. Signs should be clearly readable, information should be limited.
>
> 5. For attached signage the architectural design of the building may influence the location of the sign on the structure.
>
> 6. Light backgrounds are discouraged on internally illuminated signs because visibility is lowered by a “wrap around” effect.
>
> 7. The transportation department responsible for the adjacent public streets must
>
> review the plans for a freestanding signs to ensure conformance with safety standards prior to approval by the board.
>
> 8. Signs located within overlay districts and/or local landmarks district should be reviewed in accordance with guidelines of the applicable district.
>
> 9. Lighted signs should be designed so that they are not unnecessarily bright.
>
> 10. The scale of signs should be appropriate for the building on which they are placed and the area in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be proportionate with the scale of the structure.
>
> 11. Because residential and commercial uses generally exist in close proximity, signs should be designed and located so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods.
>
> 12. Place wall signs to establish facade rhythm, scale and proportion where facade rhythm doesn't exist. On buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade, signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion.

> 14. Select colors carefully. Color is one of the most important aspects of visual communication -- it can be used to catch the eye or to communicate ideas or feelings. Colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity. Even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection. Too many colors used thoughtlessly can confuse and negate the message of a sign.
>
> 15. Use contrasting colors. Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. A substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible.
>
> 16. Limit the number of letter styles. The number of lettering styles should be limited in order to increase legibility. A general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs. Intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate.
>
> 17. Significant signage. The preservation of designated signature signs may be used to justify increases in the overall number of attached signs on a facade as long as the integrity of the signature sign is maintained and any new signage is deemed to be compatible to the signature sign.

> further clarifies this criterion:
>
> 1. The proposed sign is in compliance with the underlying form district as described within Cornerstone 2020, typically the type of neighborhood, character of the area and traffic speeds should be considered in the design of a sign.

| C.   | Th th   | e extent of waiver of the regulation is the minimum necessary to afford relief to e applicant. The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:                               |
|------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      | 1.      | Proposals for sign area and height modifications in excess of 25% of what is permitted by chapter 8 should be carefully scrutinized to ensure compatibility with surrounding development..   |
|      | 2.      | Elevation changes between properties and adjacent streets should be reviewed to ensure that signage is appropriately visible to the street.                                                  |

> D. The applicant has either:
>
> 1. Incorporated other design measures that exceed the minimums of the district and compensate for non-compliance with the requirements to be waived (net beneficial effect). The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:
>
> a. The use of symbols or three dimensional forms is encouraged.
>
> b. Signs should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and commercial area in which they are located. A well-designed sign can be a major asset to a building. The SRB encourages imaginative and innovative sign design. The Exceptional Sign Review application procedure is specifically designed for artistic and unusual signs that might not fit the standard sign regulations and categories.
>
> 2. The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant. The following design guidelines further clarify this criterion:
>
> a. The transportation department responsible for the adjacent public streets must review the plans for freestanding signs to ensure conformance with safety standards prior to approval by the board.
>
> b. The SRB should review the layout of the land and surrounding property to determine whether relief is warranted.
>
> **Sign Authorizations**
>
> Sign Authorization Reviews shall use the same set of design guidelines as listed under the Waiver Reviews. Emphasis in sign authorizations shall be on the innovative design of signage and its potential impact on the property it relates to, surrounding properties and to the street or public realm.
