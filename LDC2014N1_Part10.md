> **9.1.2 Applicability**

Guidelines 2, 3, 7

> The requirements of this Part shall apply to all parking and loading areas in all Form Districts, whether required by this Land Development Code or created for the convenience of property owners or users. No certificate of occupancy shall be provided unless and until the appropriate motor vehicle parking and loading facilities are provided in compliance with this Part.
>
> **9.1.3 Calculating Parking Requirements / Allowances**
>
> A. Parking Spaces Required / Allowed.
>
> The minimum and maximum number of parking spaces required/allowed is based upon both the use and the Form District/Planned Development District in which that use is located. To determine the minimum number of parking spaces required and the maximum allowed, locate the applicable standard based on the Form District/ Planned Development District in which the use is located in Table 9.1.1 and apply that standard to the requirements associated with the specific use located in Table
>
> 9.1.2.
>
> B. Nonconforming parking.
>
> A use or structure with nonconforming off-street parking (e.g., insufficient offstreet parking to meet the current land use requirements in compliance with Table 9.1.2 , below) may be physically enlarged (e.g., expansion of structure or outdoor land use) or undergo a change in use in compliance with the following provisions.
>
> 1. Residential uses. No additional parking spaces shall be required; provided, the change does not increase the number of dwelling units, nor eliminate the only portion of the site that can be used for the required or existing parking or access.
>
> 2. Non-residential uses.
>
> a. The number of existing parking spaces shall be maintained on the site and additional parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with this Chapter and Subparagraph.
>
> b. If the use is enlarged (e.g., expansion of structure or outdoor land use) so that it requires more parking than the previous use, only the number of parking spaces required for the enlargement shall be required to be added to the existing parking spaces.
>
> c. If the use of the structure is changed to one that requires more parking than the previous use, only the difference between the number of parking spaces required for the previous use and those required for the new use shall be required to be added to the existing parking spaces.
>
> d. The change shall not eliminate the only portion of the site that can be used for the required or existing parking or access.
>
> C. Parking Requirements for Uses not Listed.
>
> Parking requirements for a use not specifically listed in Table 9.1.2 shall be determined by the Planning Commission or its designee based on the standards for the closest comparable use and on the particular parking demand and trip generation characteristics of the proposed use.
>
> D. Different Use Areas
>
> 1. The number of parking spaces shall be computed based on the primary uses on the site except as stated in E.2. of this Section, below. Where there are two or more separate primary uses on a site, the required or allowed parking for the site shall be the sum
>
> buildings on a site is in an accessory use, the required or allowed
>
> parking shall be calculated separately for the accessory use.
>
> Exception: An accessory use constituting twenty (20) percent or less of the gross floor area of all buildings on a site shall be calculated independently when the accessory use is specified in the parking requirements for the primary use found in Table 9.1.2.
>
> E. Calculations.
>
> 1. When the calculation of the number of required or allowed parking spaces result in fractions, any fraction less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
>
> 2. If the maximum number of parking spaces allowed is less than one, then the maximum number is automatically increased to one.
>
> 3. If the maximum number of parking spaces allowed is less than or equal to the minimum number required, then the maximum number is automatically increased to one more than the minimum.

>
> 2. A ten (10) percent reduction in the minimum required number of spaces shall apply to any development site that incorporates at least 25% of the gross floor area of the development site to residential use. An additional ten (10) percent reduction for the development site shall be applicable to developments that incorporate at least one mixed use structure that contains a minimum of five (5) residential units.
>
> 3. Applicants may defer construction of up to 30% of the required number of spaces, if the applicant commits to implement a traffic demand management plan which eliminates the need for the number of parking spaces being deferred. This 30% deferral shall be in addition to any other reductions provided in this Part. The use of this provision shall require that an area owned or controlled by the applicant and large enough to provide the deferred parking spaces be set aside and maintained as open space. The plan shall be prepared in accordance with guidance established by the Planning Director. The Director shall consult with the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities in review of the plan, and the Planning Director may approve, approve with conditions, or deny said plan. The deferral of parking space construction shall continue for as long as the traffic demand management plan is in effect and the demand for vehicle parking is satisfied on property owned or controlled by the applicant. The Director shall notify the building permit issuing department of any approved reduction in parking. Applicants shall agree to construct the deferred parking spaces if the Planning Director finds that any portion of the plan is not in effect or that the demand for vehicle parking is not being satisfied on the site. Provisions of the traffic demand management plan shall be enforceable in the same manner as binding elements.

> **9.1.10 Credit for On-Street Parking Spaces**
>
> Legal on-street parking spaces may be used to satisfy the minimum parking space requirements of this Part. The use of on-street parking spaces to satisfy the minimum parking space requirements of this Part, however, in no way limits the use of said parking spaces to customers, employees or visitors of that particular use. Such parking spaces shall be available to the general public. The use of this provision shall be in accordance with the following:
>
> A. Credit for on-street parking spaces may be given only in the Neighborhood, Traditional Neighborhood, Traditional Marketplace Corridor, Traditional Workplace, Town Center, Downtown and Village Form Districts.
>
> B. Any on-street parking space used in this manner must be located on a public street directly abutting and on the same side of the street as the development site.
>
> C. On-street parking spaces whose use is governed by parking meters or by peak hour parking restrictions may not be used to satisfy the minimum parking requirements of residential uses, but may be used for all other uses as long as the restricted hours of use do not overlap with the land use’s peak hours of operation. Bus stops, clear zones adjacent to curb cuts and other areas in which parking is prohibited shall not be included in the calculation of on-street parking spaces.
>
> D. On-street parking spaces that are not directly abutting the development site may be counted towards the minimum parking space requirements only if specifically authorized by a Parking Waiver.
>
> E. For the purposes of this section an on-street parking space shall be a minimum of
>
> 20 feet in length. Fractional spaces less than .8 (16 feet) shall not be counted as a parking space.
>
> **NOTE:**
>
> *Example: A site with 56 feet of frontage on a public street can claim credit for three parking spaces; a site with 55 feet of frontage can claim credit for two spaces.*
>
> **9.1.11 Use of Required Parking Spaces**
>
> The following shall apply to the use of required parking spaces and areas:
>
> A. Required parking spaces must be available for the use of residents, customers, visitors or employees of the use. They may not be assigned in any way to a use on another site, except where the joint use parking provisions are employed (see Section 9.1.6).
>
> B. Fees may be charged for the use of required parking spaces.
>
> C. Required parking spaces and areas shall not be used for the display, advertisement, sale, repair, dismantling or wrecking of any vehicles, equipment or materials.
>
> D. Buildings or structures shall be permitted for shelters for guards, attendants or watchmen; however, any such structure shall not occupy required parking spaces and shall be appropriately delineated on the approved development plan.
>
> *Example: If a development is required to provide a minimum of eighty (80) parking spaces and provides one-hundred (100) parking spaces, then the developer shall have the option of surfacing twenty-five (25) percent of the development's total parking area using concrete, surfacing twenty parking spaces using semi-pervious paving systems, locating twenty parking spaces within a parking structure or elevator parking facility, or of providing 25% more canopy trees within the site's ILA's than i otherwise required.*
>
> **9.1.12 Parking Area Improvements and Maintenance**
>
> A. Surfacing and Facility Type.
>
> 1. All off-street parking areas except for those serving agricultural uses shall be of a hard and durable surface that limits or precludes particulate air pollution. Asphalt, brick, concrete paving and interlocking paving blocks, including
>
> semi-pervious systems that retain space for vegetation, are acceptable paving materials. Other paving materials (including gravel) may be permitted upon approval by the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities but must include a binding agent to stabilize the surface and prevent dust.
>
> 2. Developments that provide more than fifty (50) off-street parking spaces and exceed the minimum number of parking spaces required by this Part shall either:
>
> a. Surface a portion of its total parking area proportional to the extent to which
>
> the minimum number of parking spaces is exceeded using concrete; or
>
> b. Surface the parking spaces in excess of the minimum using semi-pervious paving systems, or locate those parking spaces in excess of the minimum within parking structures or elevator parking systems: or
>
> c. Provide 25% more trees within the required Interior Landscape Area (ILA) than is otherwise required by Chapter 10 of the Land Development Code for the site’s entire parking area. The trees provided shall be Type A trees that maximize the amount of shade that is provided within the parking area. Additionally, the ILA’s shall be designed to maximize their ability to absorb the site’s stormwater runoff in an effort to improve the water quality of the stormwater runoff and to provide an adequate water supply to ensure the long term health of the canopy trees. The Planning Commission may modify this requirement if the applicant demonstrates that an alternative site design, surfacing material or facility type offers greater environmental benefits than those associated with the requirements in this Part.
>
> B. Striping. All off-street parking spaces, except for those serving detached single-family uses and agricultural uses, shall be delineated using durable painted lines that meet the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) standards or be approved by the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities. The agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities may waive this requirement based on the particular surfacing material being used and other relevant factors.
>
> C. Wheel Stops and Protective Curbing. Concrete wheel stops or curbing at least six (6) inches high and six (6) inches wide shall be provided to prevent vehicles from overhanging abutting sidewalks, properties or public rights-of-way, to protect landscaped areas and to protect adjacent properties. Such wheel stops or curbing shall be located at least three (3) feet from any adjacent wall, fence, property line, woody vegetation, walkway or structure.
>
> D. Landscaping. Parking area landscaping shall be provided in accordance with Chapter
>
> 10 of the Land Development Code.
>
> E. Lighting. Parking area lighting shall be provided in accordance with Chapter 4 of the Land Development Code.
>
> F. Litter Receptacles. All off-street parking areas serving retail uses and restaurants shall provide at least one outdoor litter receptacle within the parking area or at the building entrance. One additional outdoor litter receptacle shall be provided within the parking area or at the building entrance for each seventy-five (75) parking spaces located on the site.
>
> G. Handicapped Parking Spaces. Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided as required by local ordinances or Federal or State law. All handicapped parking spaces shall be located so that:
>
> 1. The spaces provide easy access from the closest parking area to the major entrances of the use for whichthey are provided;
>
> 2. The disabled individual is not compelled to wheel or walk behind parked cars
>
> other than his or her own; and
>
> 3. A pedestrian way accessible to physically disabled persons shall be provided from each parking space to related facilities including curb cuts and/or ramps.
>
> H. Signage. All signs within off-street parking areas shall be approved by the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities.
>
> I. Maintenance. All off-street parking areas shall be permanently and continually maintained in good condition and free from potholes, weeds, dirt, trash and other debris.
>
> J. Compact Vehicle Spaces. Up to 15% of the minimum required parking spaces may be assigned as compact vehicles spaces with approval from the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities and the requirements listed below:
>
> 1. Compact vehicles spaces shall be clearly labeled for 'Compact Cars' and shall be approved in accordance with paragraph H above.
>
> 2. The minimum dimensions of compact vehicles spaces shall be in conformance with Section 9.1.13.
>
> 3. Design techniques such as use of lampposts, bollards, extra landscaped areas at the front of compact spaces or the location of compact spaces shall be incorporated into the parking lot plan to preclude the parking of standard size vehicles in compact vehicle spaces.
>
> K. Motorcycle Parking. A commercial or other non-residential development may substitute motorcycle spaces for required automobile spaces at the rate of one (1) motocycle space for each 25 automobile spaces, up to a maximum of five (5) percent of the minimum required motor vehicles spaces. No more than one (1) motorcycle space shall be permitted per row of parking.
>
> L. Bicycle parking may substitute for up to five (5) percent of required parking spaces (as required by Table 9.1.2) in accordance with the following calculation method. For every five (5) non-required bicycle parking spaces (non-required spaces are those bicycle spaces provided in excess of those required by Table 9.2.1) that meet the short or long-term bicycle parking standards, the motor vehicle parking minimum requirement shall be reduced by one space. Existing parking may be converted to take advantage of this provision.
>
> **NOTE:**
>
> *The parking dimensions required by this Part are based on the parking turnover rate for various uses. The concept, which is published and recommended by ITE is based upon the premise that the more frequently a parking space is entered and exited, the more space is needed to accommodate for driver error.*
>
> **9.1.13 Parking Area Layout and Design**
>
> A. Access to Parking Spaces.
>
> 1. All parking areas, except stacked parking areas, must be designed so that a vehicle may enter or exit without requiring another vehicle to move.
>
> 2. Except for single-family dwellings and duplexes, each off-street parking space shall open directly upon a private aisle or private driveway of such width and design as to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular access between the parking space and public streets. Parking spaces shall be designed to preclude vehicles backing from or onto a public street. Non-residential off-street parking facilities designed for vehicles backing from or onto an alley may be allowed at the discretion of the Director of Works, while those designed for vehicles backing from or onto a private access easement may be allowed at the discretion of the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities.
>
> B. Parking Space and Aisle Dimensions
>
> 1. The dimensions of off-street parking spaces and associated drive aisles shall be determined by applying the minimum dimensional requirements found within Table 9.1.3. The width of compact vehicles spaces shall be at least eight (8) feet. The width of motorcycle spaces shall be at least five (5) feet.
>
> 2. Parking structures developed to provide the minimum number parking spaces required by this Part must meet the minimum dimensional requirements specified in Table 9.1.3, below. The design and layout of all other parking structures, including but not limited to those used to create parking spaces in excess of the maximum allowed for a particular use and those for-profit parking structures not associated with any particular use, shall be approved by the agency responsible for approval of off-street parking facilities.
>
> 3. Parking spaces serving single family residential developments located within driveways and garages need only meet the Stall Width and Stall Depth to Wall standards set forth in Table 9.1.3.
>
> 4. Parallel parking spaces shall be at least ten (10) feet in width and twenty- two
>
> (22) feet in length.
>
> 5. The Director of the Permit Issuing Authority may modify the dimensional requirements of this Section when he/she finds that such modifications would not adversely affect the functionality of the parking area and the safety of those that use it (such as the use of other acceptable standards like ITE Manual standards).

>
> 4. Required Findings**.** In granting a General Parking Waiver the Planning
>
> Commission must find that:
>
> a. All General Parking Waivers
>
> i. The Parking Waiver is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan;
>
> and
>
> ii. The applicant made a good faith effort to provide as many parking spaces as possible on the site, on other property under the same ownership, or through joint use provisions.
>
> b. Waivers to Reduce the Minimum Number of Required Parking Spaces
>
> i. The applicant made a good faith effort to provide as many parking spaces as possible on the site, on other property under the same ownership, or through joint use provisions; and
>
> ii. The requested waiver is the smallest possible reduction of parking spaces that would accommodate the proposed use; and
>
> iv. The requirements found in Table 9.1.2 do not accurately depict the
>
> parking needs of the proposed use and the requested reduction will accommodate the parking demand to be generated by the proposed use; and
>
> v. That there is a surplus of on-street or public spaces in the area that can accommodate the generated parking demand.
>
> c. Waivers to Provide More Parking Spaces than the Maximum Allowed
>
> i. The requirements found in Table 9.1.2 do not allow the provision of the number of parking spaces needed to accommodate the parking needs of the proposed use; and

>
> d. Parking waivers approved under a previous development code regulation shall be valid under this part. The parking requirement for a site that obtained a waiver under a previous development code regulation shall be based on the number of spaces required as part of the waiver approval. A property owner may abandon a parking waiver approval under a previous development code by written request to the Planning Director. The request
>
> under the LDC before review of any abandonment request.
>
> B. Residential Revitalization Parking Waivers. In cases in which the minimum parking space requirements of this Part would create hardship in the use of a particular site for residential purposes, the parking space requirements may be reduced by up to one hundred (100) percent of the spaces normally required if:
>
> 1. The site is located within a Traditional Neighborhood, Traditional Marketplace
>
> Corridor, Traditional Workplace or Town Center Form District.
>
> 2. The Planning Commission finds that the reduction of parking requirements will not create a shortage of parking spaces in the surrounding area and that the provision of parking spaces as prescribed in this Part would create a hardship or would entail extraordinary expense; and
>
> 3. For requests for reduction of parking requirements by ten (10) or more spaces, the Planning Commission finds the request to be in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. The Planning Commission may hold a public hearing on the waiver request if it determines that a public hearing is necessary.
>
> 4. Planning Commission approval or denial of any residential revitalization parking waiver request may be reviewed by the legislative body having zoning authority over the property in question, if said legislative body determines that such a review is warranted. Any such review shall be conducted as a public hearing. The owner(s) of the subject property or any aggrieved party may request such a hearing by written letter to the appropriate legislative body stating the reason(s) why such a review is warranted.

>
> **9.2.2 Applicability**

**Guideline 9**

> The requirements of this Part shall apply to all bicycle parking devices/facilities in all Form Districts, whether required by this Land Development Code or created for the convenience of property owners or users*.* No permanent certificate of occupancy shall be provided unless and until the appropriate bicycle parking facilities are provided in compliance with this Part.
>
> **NOTE:**
>
> *Temporary C.O. (Certificate of Occupancy) could be issued, to avoid costly delays for new developments in the process of installing bicycle facilities.*
>
> **9.2.3 Parking Device Type and Location Requirements**
>
> The type of bicycle parking facility, method of installation, and location of the device must be in accordance with the Bicycle Parking Facility Design Manual found in Appendix
>
> 9A. Any deviations from this Manual must be approved by the Director of Public Works. Whenever the device will be placed in the public right-of-way, the Public Works Department must approve the location.
>
> **9.2.4 Signage Requirements**
>
> Instructional signs are required unless the design of the parking device is so common or straightforward that its mode of use is self-evident. Directional signs are required if the parking locations are not easily visible when approaching the area. Directional signs that will be placed within the public right-of-way must conform to the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and be approved by the Public Works Department.
>
> **9.2.5 Parking Space Requirements**
>
> A. Calculating Space Requirements. The requirements listed in Table 9.2.1 pertain to the **number of spaces** for bicycle parking. One bicycle parking rack may have room for several parking spaces. Where an option is provided, whichever results in the greatest number of spaces is the minimum required. For land uses not specifically mentioned in the table, requirements will be determined based on the most similar use listed, except that single family and multi-family residential dwellings are exempt from bicycle parking requirements.
>
> B. Parking Requirements for Additions to Existing Structures/ Uses. The standards in Table 9.2.1 shall apply when any existing use or structure is proposed for an addition or expansion that increases the unit(s) of measurement (such as number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or number of employees) used for computing the required parking facilities for that use. When a lawful building or use not meeting the requirements for bicycle parking is increased in gross floor area by fifty (50) percent or less, then only the addition shall be required to meet the standards of this Part. The existing building or use is not required to come into compliance with the standards of this Part. When a lawful building or use not meeting the requirements for bicycle parking is increased in gross floor area by more than fifty (50) percent, then both the existing building or use and the addition shall be required to meet the standards of this Part. This provision shall be cumulative and shall apply to any single or group of successive increases that occur after the effective date of this Part.
>
> C. Reduction or Waiver Requirements. The Planning Director, upon consultation with the Director of Public Works and the Director of Building Permits, is authorized to reduce or waive the bicycle parking space requirements if there are extraordinary circumstances related to land use, adjacent road network and bicycle accessibility, availability of bicycle parking off the premises, or other mitigating circumstances.
>
> D. Short-term and Long-term Parking**.** Public bicycle parking facilities within the same block face, or within 400 feet of the main entrance for a business within a shopping center, may satisfy short-term parking requirements. Secured storage facilities with ample room and accessibility for bicycles may satisfy long-term parking requirements. While Table 9.2.1 divides the parking space requirements into long-term and short-term requirements, any bicycle parking facility that is approved in the Bicycle Parking Design Manual or specifically approved by the Public Works
>
> However, for maximum utilization of the parking facilities, it is recommended that the long-term parking spaces be secure and suitable for all-day parking.
>
> **NOTE:**
>
> ***Short-term Parking -** Short-term parking is mainly for visitors and customers. Some short-term bicycle racks have spaces for several bicycles.*
>
> ***Long-term Parking -** Long-term parking is for all-day users. They can be bicycle lockers, “bike banks,” bicycle racks in enclosed areas, or space within a building where workers may park a bicycle for the day . Many long-term parking facilities have space for only one bicycle.*

> **Appendix 9A**
>
> **Bicycle Parking Design Manual, 2002**
>
> Many people refrain from riding their bicycles for basic transportation because of a lack of secure bicycle parking spaces. The purpose of this Bicycle Parking Design Manual is to assist with the selection and installation of bicycle parking.
>
> **What are the required criteria for an acceptable bicycle parking device?**
>
> • A durable, securely-anchored device that supports the frame of the bicycle in at least one place
>
> • The device must accommodate a high security U-shaped lock that can secure the frame and at least one wheel or a cable lock that can secure the frame and both wheels.
>
> • Each parking space must have the following dimensions: 2 feet wide, 6 feet long and 7 feet high
>
> **Examples of acceptable short-term bicycle parking devices:**
>
> **“Inverted U” Racks**
>
> This rack provides two bicycle parking spaces and supports each bicycle frame in two
>
> places. It is one of the most recommended types of bicycle parking devices. In fact,
>
> ![](./media/image3.jpeg)some cities have decided to exclusively require this type of rack. The height and width of this rack vary (width 18 to 30 inches; height 32 to36 inches). Some trade names are “rib” and “bike dock.”
>
> ![](./media/image4.jpeg)
>
> **Connected Series of Angled “Inverted U” Spaces**
>
> The rack can contain a series of connected “inverted U” sections. In order to count each “inverted U” as space for two bicycles, they must be situated so that there is adequate space between them. Otherwise each “inverted U” would count as only one space. The
>
> racks with parallel sections, where two bicycles can be parked on each side of the
>
> sections are shown below.
>
> ![](./media/image5.jpeg)
>
> ![](./media/image6.jpeg)**Continuous Chain of “Inverted U” Spaces**
>
> These racks are often referred to as “waves.” The “inverted U” spaces in this type of rack are continuous and the bicycle parking spaces are perpendicular to the “inverted U”
>
> rather than parallel as in the single “inverted U” devices or the connected angled
>
> “inverted U” spaces discussed above. Some cities have made this rack type unacceptable because some cyclists park their bicycle parallel to the rack, potentially decreasing the number of bicycle spaces available to subsequent cyclists parking at the device.
>
> We have chosen to allow this device, but caution its use. Below on the left are two bicycles parked properly. Below on the right are two bicycles parked parallel to the rack. While one more bicycle can be parked on the right side of the rack (in perpendicular position) in both views below, the situation of parking parallel to the rack could make it difficult or impossible to park another bicycle at the rack.
>
> ![](./media/image7.jpeg)
>
> ![](./media/image8.jpeg)In addition, the manufacturers of some “wave” type racks state that their rack can hold
>
> more bicycles than is possible given the need for each space to be 2 feet wide and 6 feet long. The manufacturer of the “wave” rack pictured above states it will accommodate five bicycles. For that to be true bicycles would need to be parked from both directions and there would still be bicycles not fitting unless the 2 by 6 feet space is available. Therefore, caution must be used. If this type of rack is desired, consultation from Planning and Development Services is available to determine how many spaces can be counted, given the dimension of the rack and the available space for its installation.
>
> **Custom Bicycle Racks**
>
> ![](./media/image9.jpeg)There are some individuals who have fabricated a special bicycle rack. As long as each parking space meets the criteria listed in this Manual, special bicycle racks can be approved for use. Some examples are pictured below.
>
> ![](./media/image10.jpeg)
>
> Each of these custom racks consists of a durable, securely-anchored device that supports the bicycle frame in two places, the ability to accommodate a U-shaped lock or a cable lock, and two parking spaces of 2 feet by 6 feet with adequate height. There are now some firms that manufacture something similar to the rack above on the left.
>
> **Examples of acceptable long-term bicycle parking devices:**
>
> **Bicycle Bank**
>
> This is a secure bicycle parking device for one bicycle that is designed for long-term
>
> parking. It is only available from Graber Products, Madison, Wisconsin. The device has mechanisms that hold each wheel and the frame in place (as well as a locker for gear) and all are securely locked with one U-shaped lock.
>
> ![](./media/image11.jpeg)![](./media/image12.jpeg)
>
> **Bicycle Locker**
>
> This is a fully enclosed, secure locker that can hold a bicycle and gear. It protects the bicycle from the weather and is intended for long-term storage. There are various mechanisms for locking the door.
>
> ![](./media/image13.jpeg)
>
> **Other Long-Term Parking**
>
> A secured storage facility that has ample room and accessibility for employees to park their bicycles may be used to satisfy the parking requirements as long as it meets all the criteria for an acceptable parking facility in this Manual.
>
> **Examples of Unacceptable Bicycle Racks:**
>
> ![](./media/image14.jpeg)Bicycle racks and parking devices that only support one wheel of the bicycle are not acceptable for satisfying the LDC Bicycle Parking Standards. Some names commonly used for these racks are:
>
> • wheel holder
>
> • fence style
>
> • grid style
>
> **Illustrations of Unacceptable**

>
> ![](./media/image16.jpeg)
>
> **What are the requirements for selecting a location for the bicycle parking device?**
>
> • If there is one building associated with the installation, locate short-term bicycle parking devices at least as close to the primary entrance as is the nearest non- handicapped automobile parking space.
>
> • Parking spaces must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) long and 2 feet (0.6 m) wide with an overhead clearance of 7 feet (2.1m).
>
> • Device must be a minimum of 2 feet from a parallel wall and 2.5 feet from a perpendicular wall.
>
> • Provide an aisle of at least 5 feet (1.5 m) between rows of bicycle parking.
>
> • If located on or next to a sidewalk, a minimum of 5 feet of clear sidewalk must remain when bicycles are parked at the device
>
> • If the device is installed at a transit stop, its location cannot impede transit boarding.
>
> • The bicycle parking device cannot impede pedestrian travel.
>
> • Where automobile parking is covered, bicycle parking shall also be covered.
>
> • If the installation is near a curb on a street with motor vehicle parking, at least three feet of space must remain between a bicycle parked at the rack and the curb.
>
> • Whenever the device will be placed in the public right-of-way, the Public Works
>
> Department must approve the location.
>
> **What are the signage requirements for bicycle parking facilities?**
>
> • Instructional signs are required unless the design of the bicycle parking facility is so common or straightforward that its mode of use is self-evident to a prospective user.
>
> • Directional signs are required if the parking locations are not easily visible when approaching the area. Directional signs that will be placed within the public right-of- way must conform to the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and be approved by the Public Works Department.
