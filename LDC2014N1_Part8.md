>
> Procedures for Major Subdivisions
>
> If the subdivision construction entrance is accessed from a roadway classified as a local street, the subdivider or applicant shall post an Encroachment Bond with Public Works.

>
> **7.2.35 Conditions of Permit/Work Order and Authority of Inspectors**
>
> It is a condition of the issuance of a Site Disturbance Permit or a Work Order that the property and operations on it be open to inspection by the Director of Works, MSD, and the Director of Planning and their authorized agents or representatives at all times and that the subdivider and his agents shall abide by any order of said inspector(s) for the purpose of assuring conformance with approved plans. Application for such Permit or Work Order and any operations pursuant thereto shall be deemed to constitute consent to these conditions. Refusal to abide by an order of an authorized inspector or to allow the required inspection shall be a violation of these regulations. Further, willful or persistent failure to abide by such orders shall constitute just cause for the respective director to refuse construction approval and issue a stop work order for the particular subdivision, in addition to any other remedies available.
>
> **7.2.40 Record Plat**
>
> Before transferring title to any portion of a subdivision a record plat must be recorded. The subdivider shall obtain Commission approval to be shown on the record plat prior to its recording. Approval may be obtained in accordance with the following procedures:
>
> A. *Formal Application and Submission* - The subdivider shall file formal application for subdivision approval on a form supplied by the Commis- sion and shall submit therewith a record plat prepared by a land surveyor in conformance with the requirements of Part 7. If application for a

>
> Commission action when it is deemed appropriate.
>
> Procedures for Major Subdivisions
>
> B. *Commission Action* - Within 90 days of receipt of the record plat, the Commission shall take action on the plat and notify the subdivider in writing of its action. Commission action shall take one of the following forms:
>
> 1. *Approval* - The Commission may approve the plat as submitted.
>
> The Commission shall certify its approval on the face of the plat so that it may be recorded in the office of the County Clerk of Jefferson County.
>
> 2. *Conditional Approval* - The Commission may approve the plat conditionally and require amendments to the plat before granting full approval. If the subdivider does not submit an acceptable amended plat within 90 days of submission of the original plat, the plat shall be deemed to be disapproved by the Commission.
>
> 3. *Postponement* - The Commission may postpone its decision pending further study of the plat, but in no event shall its decision be postponed more than 90 days after submission of the plat.
>
> 4. *Disapproval* - The Commission may disapprove a plat and shall state in writing its reasons for disapproval. The subdivider must then reapply if he wishes to create the subdivision.
>
> **7.2.45 Subdivider's Commitment and Bond Requirement**
>
> Before Planning Commission approval may be shown on the record plat for recording, the subdivider shall deliver to the Director of Works the following items:
>
> A. *Subdivider's Commitment* - The subdivider shall be responsible for the installation, good repair and proper functioning of all improvements, including private roads, required by the approved construction plan and the installation of all reference monuments required by the record plat. Installation shall begin within a year after approval of the record plat, or within any one year extension granted by the Director of Works, and shall proceed in a manner which, in the judgment of the Director of Works, does not cause unreasonable harm, inconvenience or annoyance to any other property owner in or outside of the subdivision. The judgment of
>
> the Director of Works with respect to the manner of proceeding may not be questioned in any judicial proceeding by anyone except the subdivider, but said judgment when exercised in favor of the subdivider shall not constitute a defense to the subdivider in a judicial action against the subdivider by a complaining property owner. This obligation of the subdivider shall continue until the Director of Works, acting on behalf of the Planning Commission, has granted a release pursuant to Section
>
> 7.2.60. The required installations shall be completed and properly functioning within five (5) years from the date of which construction plans are approved, unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the Director of Works in writing. If eighty percent (80%) of the lots do not have a completed structure on them, the subdivider may request that the Director of Works, also acting on behalf of MSD, waive
>
> the eighty percent (80%) requirement and notify the Planning Commission of such waiver. If the waiver is granted, the subdivider or design engineer, acting on behalf of the subdivider, shall initiate the bond release process by sending a written request for bond release inspection to Public Works, MSD, the Health Department, and the local
>
> fire protection district. At any time after the date of approval of the record plat, the subdivider shall abide by any time limits which the Director of Works may specify in writing. This obligation shall be evidenced in
>
> writing signed by the subdivider on forms provided by the Director of
>
> Works.
>
> B. *Security Required* - There shall be filed with the Director of Works a bond instrument(s) approved by the Planning Commission and in the amounts determined by the Director of Works and MSD to insure fulfillment of the subdivider's commitment as set out above. Reduction of bond requirements shall not alter the subdivider's liability for fulfilling the obligations set out in Section 7.2.45 (1).
>
> **7.2.50 Reduction of Bond Amount**
>
> The amount of bond may be reduced by the Director of Works, on the recommendation of MSD and acting on behalf of the Planning Commission one time only. No bond shall be reduced below an amount necessary to insure the installation of remaining improvements and the good repair and proper functioning of all improvements at the time when eighty percent (80%) of the lots shown on the record plat have primary structures built on them and appropriate measures taken to prevent erosion and siltation. The reduced amount shall be determined by Public Works and MSD upon construction of the internal roadway infrastructure. The design engineer shall submit a certificate as set forth in Part 9.35 to Public Works and MSD.
>
> **7.2.55 Bond Instruments**
>
> The subdivider shall post a bond instrument with Public Works to insure proper installation of the road and drainage improvements. In addition, the subdivider shall post an encroachment and/or clearing and grading bond with Public
>
> Works and/or MSD. The bond instrument may be in the form of a letter of credit or certificate of deposit with a properly executed assignment and notice, in the total bond amount. If the subdivider posts a surety bond, $3,000 of the total bond amount must be in the form of a letter of credit or a certificate of deposit with a properly executed assignment and notice.
>
> **7.2.60 Subdivider's Release from Guaranteeing Proper Functioning**
>
> A subdivider may request a release from responsibility for the good repair and proper functioning of required improvements by the Planning Commission in accordance with the following procedures:
>
> A. A written request for release shall be submitted to the Director of Works with copies sent to Metropolitan Sewer District, the Board of Health, the agency or official having jurisdiction with respect to fire protection, and the Mayor or designee if the subdivision is located within an incorporated city. This release may be requested after primary buildings have been
>
> Procedures for Major Subdivisions
>
> built on 80% of all lots shown on the record plat and the street improvements (public and private), drainage facilities, but not including sidewalks on unimproved lots, have been installed in a good and workmanlike manner and are functioning in accordance with the approved construction plans.
>
> B. After eighty percent (80%) of the lots shown on the record plat have primary structures built on them, the subdivider may request bond release. Upon receipt of a written request from a subdivider, the appropriate agencies must inspect the subdivision and inform the subdivider in writing of approval or deficiencies within thirty (30) days. If deficiencies are noted, the subdivider shall have forty-five (45) days to complete the repairs and request re-inspection. The agency shall re- inspect and advise the subdivider of approval or further deficiencies within two weeks. Each agency shall provide original inspection reports and release approvals to Public Works. If the subdivider disagrees with the written comments received, an appeal may be filed with the Planning
>
> Commission. The Commission shall review this request through the Land
>
> Development and Transportation Committee.
>
> C. Upon obtaining a written release from all appropriate agencies, the Director of Works may release the subdivision bond completely or reduce the bond to an amount necessary to insure the installation of sidewalks, related drainage and any other right-of-way and easement
>
> improvements. This bond shall be considered as if it were a separate bond designed solely for that purpose to be released by the approval of the Director of Works with the approval of the appropriate agencies. If a sidewalk only, pavement only, or drainage only bond is required, it shall be of a limited time period to insure that all such improvements are constructed and fully functioning within two years of date of said bond. The eighty percent (80%) figure referred to above may be increased or reduced by the Director of Works, as specified in Section 7.2.45 (1).

> **7.2.65 Builders Commitment**
>
> A builder on any lot in the subdivision shall be responsible for the good repair and proper functioning of all installed improvements required by the approved construction plan and installed reference monuments required by the record
>
> plat and shall proceed with construction in a manner which is satisfactory to the Director of Works and the subdivider, and which does not cause unreasonable harm, inconvenience or annoyance to any other property owner in or outside of the subdivision. The judgment of the Director of Works or that of the subdivider with respect to the manner of construction may not be questioned in any judicial proceeding by any one except the builder, but said judgment when exercised in favor of the builder, shall not constitute a defense to the builder in a judicial action against the builder by a complaining property owner. An applicant for a building permit shall execute and deliver written evidence of his awareness and commitment to fulfill this obligation on forms approved by the Director of Works.
>
> The builder of each lot in a subdivision is required to grade the lot so that cross-lot drainage is in conformance with the approved Composite Drainage Plan for the subdivision and all drainage from the lot is directed to a public drainage facility in an easement or right-of-way.
>
> **7.2.70 Builder's Bonds Required**
>
> At the time of the subdivider's release from guaranteeing proper functioning of required improvements pursuant to Section 2.60, each builder is required to post with the Director of Works and/or M.S.D. a Builder’s Bond prior to the issuance of the building permit to insure the fulfillment of the obligations set out in Section 7.2.65 and to insure compliance with the tree canopy requirements and sidewalk requirements in accordance with Part 4. The bond shall be in the
>
> amount of $2,500.00 or an appropriate amount as determined by the Director of Works, the Director of Planning, and/or M.S.D. In the event a building permit has been issued on unimproved lots that are sensitive to generation of drainage related damages to existing development at the time of release of the subdivider's performance bond, a $2,500.00 bond or an appropriate amount shall be posted on those lots by the builder. "Unimproved lots" refers to those
>
> on which no primary building has been constructed.
>
> **7.2.75 Release of Builder's Bond**
>
> Application for release of a builder's bond (7.2.70) may be made by filing a certificate with the Planning Commission and the Director of Works or M.S.D. in conformance with Section 7.9.42 bearing notice that false statements made therein are punishable. Within 60 days of receipt of application for release of a builders bond, the Director of Planning, Director of Works or M.S.D. may make an inspection of the subdivision and shall grant the release where it appears to his reasonable satisfaction that the required improvements are installed and are in good repair and functioning properly on and adjacent to the lot and that there is no reason to believe that construction on the lot has or will cause malfunctioning of installed improvements in other areas.
>
> **7.2.80 Property Owner's Obligation**
>
> It is the obligation of a property owner in the subdivision not to damage, alter or destroy the required improvements or reference monuments and not to allow any condition or activity on his property that will impair the proper functioning of the required improvements. For violation of this provision, the property shall be subject to the imposition of a lien for the amount necessary to remedy the violations which may be enforced in the same manner that mortgages are enforced, in addition to other remedies available.
>
> **7.2.85 Enforcement and Remedying of Obligations**
>
> If, at any time following the period allowed to the subdivider to complete his obligations (7.2.45 (1)), the Director of Works and/or MSD finds that the required improvements and reference monuments have not been installed or
>
> that they are not in good repair or that they are not functioning properly and also finds that it does not appear to his satisfaction that they will be completed within a reasonable time considering the potential for harm, inconvenience or annoyance to others, he shall recommend that the Planning Commission
>
> declare the obligation of the subdivider, as well as the obligation of any others who may appear to him to be responsible, to be in default.
>
> Upon declaration of default, the Director of Works and/or MSD shall collect such amounts from bonds or otherwise as is required to remedy the default. In the
>
> Procedures for Major Subdivisions
>
> event that amounts available from bonds are sufficient to cover the costs of remedying the default, such bonds shall be collected and used in full or in such proportion as the Director of Works or MSD determines to be just and equitable based upon apparent responsibility therefor. Anyone claiming to be aggrieved by such determination shall have as his exclusive remedy a cause of action for contribution or indemnity against the parties responsible for the default. The determination of the Director of Works or MSD shall not be used as evidence in support of or against responsibility in such cause of action, and he shall not be made a party thereto.
>
> In the event that the Planning Commission has authorized bond forfeiture for any section(s) of a subdivision for which the applicant is responsible, no additional sections of the subdivision may be recorded until such time as the Metro Public Works Department notifies the Planning Commission that the roadway and drainage improvements for the previously recorded section(s) in accordance with the approved construction plans have been completed.
>
> **7.3.10 Streets**
>
> A. In or adjoining any major subdivision of land hereafter proposed, access from new lots or a new street connecting an existing street shall not be approved unless the Planning Commission, with input from the Director of Works, determines that the subdivision will be served by an adequate street network. In order to be considered adequate, the street or combination of streets providing most direct means of access to an arterial level street shall have a minimum roadway width of 18 feet of pavement. The Commission may determine, based on input from the Director of Works, that the traffic flow associated with a proposed
>
> subdivision will utilize more than one route to one or more arterial streets. As a result of such determination, the Planning Commission may require that more than one route (street or combination of streets) must have a minimum roadway width of 18 feet. In addition to the roadway width, the Planning Commission may require other off-site improvements to correct conditions that would impede the safe flow of traffic associated with the new subdivision. Subdivisions that create no more than five lots of five acres or more each are not subject to the requirements of this paragraph. (Arterial level streets are shown on Core Graphic 10: Roadway Classifications and Projected Corridors). The provisions of this
>
> paragraph shall not apply to roads that are Designated Roads under the System Development Charges for Roadways Ordinance \[insert LMCO citation\].
>
> B. Continuation of existing streets. Subdivisions shall be designed to ensure that existing public and private streets which stub into the subject property can be extended through the subject property. For subdivisions creating any lot that abuts or has access to any proposed stub street extension, right-of-way shall be dedicated sufficient to accommodate the extension of the street, and the street shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this Land Development Code for constructing public or private roads.
>
> **7.3.20 Blocks**

>
> **Conservation Area**: Land to remain undisturbed as part of the development of a Conservation Subdivision. Conservation Areas are made up of Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas. All lands identified as Primary Conservation Areas shall be Conservation Areas. If the Primary Conservation Area makes up less than the required percentage of the tract, the balance of the required Conservation Areas shall be made up of Secondary Conservation Areas.
>
> Conservation Subdivisions
>
> **Conservation Subdivision**: A contiguous area of land to be planned and developed as a single entity in which buildings are accommodated under more flexible standards, such as building arrangements and setbacks, than those that would normally be applied following conventional Subdivision regulations, allowing for the flexible grouping of structures in order to conserve open space and existing natural resources.
>
> **Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan**: A comprehensive analysis of existing conditions and unique characteristics both on the proposed development site and within 500 feet of the site used for the purpose to assess accuracy and compliance with existing LDC ordinances and likely impact upon the natural and cultural resources on the property.
>
> **Lane:** A private street or easement located to the side or rear of property that serves vehicular and service access. A rear lane functions the same as an alley, but may differ in character due to its surface material, landscaping treatment, adjacent open space, and sensitivity to adjacent natural feature.
>
> **Maximum Density:** The net density of residential units per acre allowed in a Conservation Subdivision after subtracting the total constrained land from the gross acreage of the development parcel.
>
> **Minimum Required Conservation Area:** The percentage and acreage of required Conservation Areas shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of all plans. Road rights-of-way shall not be counted towards the required minimum Conservation Area.
>
> **Neighborhood Green:** A human-scaled common open space typically surrounded by homes or important community buildings which is designed as a focal point for neighborhood/block events and gathering space. The Green is best located where it is accessible to the highest possible amount of residents and should include landscaping, paths, and amenities that encourage use and facilitate a sense of community.
>
> **Passive Recreation Area:** Areas dedicated to recreation activities that require limited physical exertion on behalf of the participant has minimal impact upon the natural environment and wildlife. Examples of passive recreation activities include bird watching, walking, hiking, picnicking, horseback riding, or photography.
>
> **Preliminary Conservation Area Ownership and Management Plan**: A document which shall accompany the application packet for a Conservation Subdivision Preliminary Plan filing that details the entities responsible for maintaining various elements of the property, and describing management objectives and techniques for each part of the property.
>
> **Primary Conservation Areas (PCA)**: Areas of permanently protected open space within Conservation Subdivisions that comprise only the most severely constrained lands, where development is typically limited such as wetlands, floodplains, identified karst feature (i.e. sinkhole, etc.), steep slopes 30% or over, unstable soils, cemeteries, and habitats of endangered or threatened species.
>
> **Secondary Conservation Areas (SCA)**: Areas of permanently protected open space within Conservation Subdivisions that are locally noteworthy or significant features of the natural or culture landscape such as mature woodlands, hedgerow and freestanding trees or tree groups, wildlife habitats and travel corridors, prime farmland, greenways and trails, historic sites and buildings, and scenic viewsheds.
>
> **Sketch Plan Overlay:** A conceptual drawing of the development site in which the applicant shows a schematic layout of Conservation Areas, building lots, general infrastructure, and proposed general street and lot layout.
>
> **Terminal Vista**: An urban design feature in which a visual termination focuses on the end of the visual end of the street utilizing long views of items such as open space, important buildings, water, or distant topographic features.
>
> **Vegetative Cover:** Grasses, shrubs, trees, and other vegetation which holds and stabilizes soils.
>
> **7.11.3 Applicability**
>
> **Zoning Code Requirements:** Conservation Subdivisions are permitted in the

> **7.11.5 DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS**
>
> In addition to the Technical Standards for Conservation Subdivisions as set
>
> forth in **Section 7.11.15**, an applicant for developing a Conservation Development shall maintain critical natural areas by designing the site with sensitivity. The following criteria shall be followed to ensure that the project is appropriate for the site’s natural, historic and cultural features and meets the objectives of this regulation:
>
> **A.** Lots and buildings must be clustered to minimize negative impacts on the natural, scenic, and cultural resources of the site and conflicts between incompatible uses.
>
> **B.** Whenever possible, open space shall connect with existing or potential open space lands on adjoining parcels and local or regional recreational trails.
>
> Conservation Subdivisions
>
> **C.** Clusters shall be sited to achieve the following goals:
>
> **1.** Minimize disturbance to woodlands, wetlands, grasslands, mature trees, and steep slopes.
>
> **2.** Prevent downstream impacts due to runoff through storm water Best Management Practices (BMPs) as determined by the Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD). Such BMPs include minimizing impermeable areas, and using bioswales, rain gardens, permeable pavements, small-scale, infiltration, and green roofs.
>
> **3.** Protect views of open land from existing adjacent roadways. Visual impacts should be minimized through use of practices such as orienting structures to align with topographic character of land, tucking structures behind tree lines or knolls, using vegetation as a backdrop to reduce prominence of the structures, varying setbacks, setting aside required conservation land as a visual amenity into and within the development site, or any combination of these practices.
>
> **4.** Protect archaeological sites and existing historic buildings or incorporate them through adaptive reuse.
>
> **5.** Avoid encroaching on sensitive areas such as rare plant communities, high quality habitats, or endangered species habitats identified by the Kentucky Department for Natural Resources.
>
> **7.11.6 Conservation Areas**
>
> Conservation Areas are land to remain undisturbed as part of the development of a Conservation Subdivision. Conservation Areas shall consist of at least thirty percent (30%) of the total proposed subdivision acreage for property located in the R-5 and R-4 zoning districts and at least sixty percent (60%) of the total proposed subdivision acreage for property located in the R-R through R-3 zoning districts. Conservation Areas are made up of Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas. All lands identified as Primary Conservation
>
> Areas shall be Conservation Areas. If the Primary Conservation Area makes up less than the required percentage of the tract, the balance of the required Conservation Areas shall be made up of Secondary Conservation Areas.
>
> **A. Primary Conservation Areas (PCA).** PCA’s form the core of the Conservation Area to be protected. Active recreation areas are prohibited in PCA’s unless approved by the Director.. PCA’s, as defined by this regulation, include the following:
>
> **1.** Cemeteries;
>
> **2.** Habitats for endangered or threatened species as defined by the
>
> Kentucky Department for Natural Resources;
>
> **3.** Alluvial soils identified by the Federal Emergency Management
>
> Agency (FEMA) and 100-Year floodplain;
>
> **4.** Unstable soils as determined by the Natural Resources
>
> Conservation Services and depicted in Core Graphic 5;
>
> **5.** Protected Waterways and their Buffer Areas (100 feet) including:
>
> **a.** Any perennial stream or river (or portion thereof) that is portrayed as solid on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle maps, of the most recent edition;
>
> **b.** Wetlands subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the Army Corps of Engineers and additional standards established in **Section 4.8.5**;
>
> **c.** Lakes of greater than three acres in size, and with a permanent pool elevation that constitute “waters of the Commonwealth” as defined in KRS Chapter 224.
>
> **d.** Other bodies of water designated as Protected Water Bodies through official nomination and appropriate legislative approval.
>
> **6.** Riparian zones equal to any required stream buffers and improvement setbacks;
>
> **7.** Karst features subject to development restrictions as defined in
>
> **Chapter 4.9**.
>
> **8.** Existing slopes greater than 30% on average with a site area greater than 5,000 square feet identified as part of a site analysis conducted by a registered engineer, land surveyor or landscape architect and calculated using topographic maps from Louisville- Jefferson Geographic Information Consortium (LOJIC) or from a topographic survey prepared by a licensed land surveyor.
>
> Conservation Subdivisions
>
> **B. Secondary Conservation Areas (SCA).** SCAs consist of undeveloped, unconstrained, buildable land, and protected, constrained but buildable lands. Because active recreation areas are cleared and graded and therefore reduce natural resources and wildlife habitats, only 50% of active recreation areas and facilities may be counted as Conservation Area. SCAs, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:
>
> **1.** Farmlands (fields, pastures, meadows, prime agriculture soils);
>
> **2.** Woodlands and landscape buffers excluding riparian buffers;
>
> **3.** Historic and/or archaeological sites as identified by the Kentucky Heritage Council or Louisville Landmarks Commission, excluding cemeteries;
>
> **4.** Passive recreation areas, public and private, to include pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails, picnic areas, community commons or greens, and similar areas;
>
> **5.** Active recreation areas and facilities, public and private, including parks as identified by the Metro Parks and Recreation Master Plan, playing fields, and playgrounds.
>
> **C. Conservation Area Design Review Standards.** The configuration of
>
> Conservation Area land shall comply with the following standards:
>
> **1.** Where the proposed development adjoins public park land, a conservation area of at least thirty (30) feet shall be provided within the development along its common boundary with the park land or conservation easement, within which no new structures shall be constructed and no clearing of trees or understory growth shall be permitted (except as necessary for street or trail construction). Where this buffer is unwooded, the Planning Director or designee may require that vegetative screening be planted or that the buffer be managed to encourage natural forest succession through “no- mow” policies and the periodic removal of invasive alien plant and tree species. **EXCEPTION**: Housing facing park land or park boundary road is not required to have above listed conservation area.
>
> **2.** Conservation Area land shall be interconnected wherever possible to existing and potential Conservation Areas on adjacent properties as well as to other internal Conservation Areas on the development site to provide a continuous network of such lands within and adjoining the development site.
>
> **3.** Except for civic and recreational spaces, such as squares and playing fields, Conservation Areas shall be free of all structures, excluding, however, historic buildings, stone walls, and structures related to Conservation Area land uses. Structures and improvements made for storm drainage, sewage treatment, and water supply may be located in the Conservation Area land. Acreage set aside for such uses shall not be credited towards the minimum required Conservation Area, unless the land remains appropriate for passive recreational use.
>
> **4.** Except in those cases where a portion of the Conservation Area is located on private house lots, this Conservation Area land shall provide for pedestrian pathways for use by the residents of the subdivision. Consideration shall be given to providing for public access on such trails if they are linked to other publicly accessible pathway systems within Louisville Metro or an adjoining jurisdiction. Provisions should be made for access to the Conservation Area land, as required for land management and emergency purposes.
>
> **5.** Conservation Area land shall adjoin the largest practicable number of lots within the development. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe and convenient pedestrian access to Conservation Area land.
>
> **6.** Conservation Area land shall be suitably landscaped either by retaining existing natural cover and wooded areas or according to a landscaping plan to protect and enhance greenway resources. In any case, preservation and retention of natural cover is preferable and may be supplemented by additional landscaping where necessary.
>
> **7.** The Conservation Area shall be contiguous. Contiguous shall be defined as being connected based on the following:
>
> **a.** The minimum width of any Conservation Area is 30 feet and shall contain at least 6,000 square feet of contiguous area unless the Conservation Area is the terminus of a cul-de-sac, where the minimum width of 15 feet shall be permitted.
>
> **b.** All Conservation Area networks shall provide connectivity to any common areas within the development and to any adjacent public places or rights-of-way.
>
> **c.** Where path networks cross internal subdivision streets or public streets, access points shall be directly across from each other or as approved by the Planning Director or designee.
>
> **d.** Crossings and access points shall be clearly identified to pedestrians and motorists and may include traffic control devices, bridges and tunnels as approved by Planning Director or designee.
>
> Conservation Subdivisions
>
> **8.** Conservation Areas will still be considered connected if separated by a roadway. The Planning Director may waive the requirement of connectivity for all or part of the required Conservation Area where
>
> it is determined that allowing non-contiguous Conservation Area
>
> will promote the goals of this section or protect identified PCAs and
>
> SCAs.
>
> **9.** Common and non-common areas in Conservation Area land shall be preserved for its designated uses and shall be made subject to such agreement with Louisville Metro Government and such conservation easements, duly recorded with the office of Jefferson County Clerk as may be required by Louisville Metro Government.
>
> **a.** The percentage of the Conservation Area that is wetlands shall not typically exceed the percentage of the tract which is wetlands; provided, however, the applicant may include a greater percentage of wetlands in such Conservation Area upon a demonstration that such inclusion promotes the purposes of this regulation.
>
> **10.** Paths or walkways may be permitted within Wetland and Protected Waterway Buffer Areas if constructed of pervious materials and demonstrate compliance with standards established in **Chapter 4.8** of the LDC.
>
> **11.** Conservation Areas shall be used for wildlife habitat, conservation, and other uses compatible with these regulations.
>
> **a**
>
> **4.** Include cost estimates for maintenance, including staffing, operation, or insurance costs, if any.
>
> **5.** Identify a board and procedures for oversight of an enforcement of the Management Plan.
>
> **C. Ownership and Management**. Any management organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instrument shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its function (Management Entity). Options for ownership and management of preserved area include:
>
> **1.** Fee Simple dedication to Louisville Metro Government or other public entity subject to acceptance by and at the sole discretion of Louisville Metro Government or other public entity.
>
> **2.** Creation of or dedication to a Homeowners Association capable of carrying out the ownership and management plan. The Planning Commission Legal Counsel shall determine that, based on documents submitted with the development plan, the Association's bylaws or code of regulations specify the following requirements:
>
> **a.** Membership in the Association shall be mandatory for all purchasers of lots in the development or units in the condominium.
>
> **b.** The Association shall be responsible for maintenance, control, and insurance of common areas, including the dedicated conservation areas.
>
> **3.** Establishment of an endowment where the principal generates sufficient annual interest to cover the yearly costs of ownership and maintenance of the preserved area.
>
> **4.** Dedication to a private or not-for-profit entity such as a land trust or similar conservation-oriented organization with the legal authority and financial capacity to accept such dedications.
>
> **5.** Dedication of a conservation easement on the Conservation Areas to any of the above entities with a right of enforcement in favor of Louisville Metro Government stated in the easement.
>
> Conservation Subdivisions
>
> **D.** Right of Enforcement. In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the Conservation Areas fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition according to the Management Plan, Louisville Metro Government may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may
>
> enter the premises and take corrective action, including provision of extended maintenance. The cost of maintenance may be charged to the Management Entity, or the individual property owners according to the pro-rata share based on the Management Plan. Costs may include administrative costs in taking such actions as well as penalties as provided under these regulations. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties.
>
> **E.** Review. The legal restrictions and ownership and Management Plan shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning Director or the Planning Commission Legal Counsel.
>
> **7.11.8 Dedication of Conservation Areas for Public Use.**
>
> Applicants shall comply with relevant standards in **Chapter 10.5.4** of the LDC pertaining to dedicating a portion of the development site for public recreational use.
>
> **7.11.9 Technical Standards for Conservation Subdivisions**
>
> **A. Density Calculation**: The maximum total number of lots permitted for Conservation Subdivisions shall be based on the amount of dwelling units per acre permitted in the underlying zoning district, classes RR through
>
> R-5, minus the Primary Conservation Areas (PCA) and land typically allocated for infrastructure. For purpose of this calculation, a 10% bonus of maximum lots permitted (MLP) may be added to those sites pursuing conservation areas 50% or greater of the development site in R4 and R5 zoned districts. The resulting density shall serve as a guide and shall not exceed the underlying zoning district, unless the applicant chooses to pursue a zoning change. The base density allowed on the site shall be calculated by:
>
> MLP= *TA-PCA-IA* Zoning District Min. Lot Area

MLP = Maximum Lots Permitted

> TA =Total Land Area

PCA =Primary Conservation Area

> IA =Infrastructure Area (10% of TA)
>
> **EXAMPLE: Total Land Area (TA): 50 acres Primary Conservation Areas**
>
> **(PCA): 12 acres**
>
> **Maximum Lot Calculation**

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MLP=(50 –12-5 (acres))/9000 sf   | MLP=(50 –12-5 (acres))/ 6000 sf   |
| MLP = 33 acres 1 / 9,000 sf.     | MLP = 33 acres 1 / 6,000 sf.      |
| MLP = 1,437,480 sf./9,000sf.     | MLP = 1,437,480 sf./6.000sf       |
| MLP=160 lots                     | MLP = 239 lots                    |
| *With bonus 10%:*                | *With bonus 10%:*                 |
| MLP = 176 lots or 3.52 du/acre   | MLP = 263 or 5.26 du/acre         |

> 1 Calculation is in acres. To convert acres to square feet, multiply result by 43,560.

> **C. Building and Lot Design Standards.**
>
> **1.** Conservation subdivisions may include off-street guest parking areas within Secondary Conservation Areas only, particularly in blocks that contain lot widths less than 30 feet. The parking area shall be constructed using approved pervious paving methods and shall not occupy more than 15% of the total Conservation Area lot. The addition of parking spaces shall not be deemed a reduction in the size of the Conservation Area with regard to the minimum Conservation Area requirement.
>
> **2.** Rear facades shall not be oriented to existing or proposed streets.
>
> Rear facades may face interstate highways, alleys or rear lanes.
>
> **3.** Lot Frontage on a Conservation Area. Conservation subdivisions may be designed with lots fronting onto Conservation Areas with all vehicular access from alleys or lanes approved by Public Works and all other approving agencies. All alleys and rear lanes in Conservation Subdivisions are additionally subject to the requirements of **Section 7.11.9.D.2**.
>
> **D. Compatibility with Adjacent Development**
>
> **1.** Buildable lots shall be designed and located to ensure compatibility with existing adjacent development.
>
> **2.** Views of house lots from exterior roads and abutting properties shall be minimized by preserving the natural topography and existing vegetation to the furthest extent possible.
>
> **3.** The Planning Director or designee may require an alternative
>
> design of portions of the site plan in order to fulfill subsections 1and
>
> 2 above.
>
> **E. Streetscape Standards**
>
> **1. Streets**. The street network shall form a generally connected pattern, with a minimum of cul-de-sacs, and shall be varied with boulevards, diagonal streets, curving crescents, eyebrows, ovals and courts to provide visual interest. Local street design shall shall adhere to the following standards:
>
> **a.** Street patterns shall be designed to respect and follow the existing natural topography and to limit the amount of grading and tree removal required for construction to the greatest extent possible. Street grades shall conform with standards established in Section 6.2.3 of the LDC.
>
> **b.** All streets, with the exception of loop streets, cul-de-sacs, and loop lanes, shall terminate at other streets within the
>
> subdivision, and at least two streets shall provide connections to existing or proposed through-streets or collectors outside the subdivision, wherever practicable.

> **c.** To the greatest extent practicable, streets shall be designed to have maximum lengths of 600 feet between intersections and maximum lengths of 1,200 feet before terminating at three-way “T” intersections or angling off in a diagonal direction. Blocks greater than 600 feet long shall provide a Conservation Area.
>
> **d.** Loop lanes or cul-de-sacs shall be designed to not exceed 1000 feet in length. Loop lanes shall be designed as a single one-way lane, not less than 18 feet in pavement width, with a central median running the entire length. The median shall be at least
>
> 30 feet wide, and shall be planted with shade trees along both sides at intervals not less than 1 Large (Type A) tree per 50 lineal feet of right-of-way, or 1 medium (Type B) tree per 40 lineal feet, or 1 Small (Type C) tree per 30 lineal feet. Small trees are permitted only where utility lines or other site constraints will not allow planting of Large or Medium trees.
>
> **2. Street trees.** Street trees shall:
>
> **a.** Be planted along each side of all streets in or adjacent to the development site, public or private, existing or proposed, including arterials (only the side adjacent to the development site), but excluding alleys and rear access lanes. Existing healthy and mature street trees may be counted toward the street tree planting requirement.
>
> **b.** New street trees shall be in accordance with recommended street tree types as listed in **Appendix 10A** of the LDC and be installed in groupings that appear natural rather than equally spaced rows.
>
> **c.** Be installed at intervals no greater than 40 ft, planted in a clustered pattern with spacing approved by PDS staff.

>
> **3. Sidewalks.** Public sidewalks (including informal walkways and footpaths) shall:
>
> **a.** Create a linked network of walkways connecting all uses with parks and other greenway land areas.
>
> **b.** Link loop streets and the ends of cul-de-sacs with the street network, trails, or greenway land behind the lots served by those loop streets or cul-de-sacs.
>
> **c.** Be separated from street curbs by a verge not less than five feet in width, planted with shade trees in accordance with **Section 7.11.9.D.3**.
>
> **d.** Be provided along the front lot lines of all residential lots to ensure pedestrian access to each lot. Sidewalks shall be provided along the front lot lines of residential lots fronting directly onto common greens or parks.
>
> **e.** Be permitted along one side of the street rights-of-way only when a proposed walkway system provides pedestrian access equal to or better than the provision of sidewalks along. Walkways located in Primary Conservation Areas (PCAs) shall be constructed of pervious material such as pervious concrete, gravel, wood chips or other similar materials.
